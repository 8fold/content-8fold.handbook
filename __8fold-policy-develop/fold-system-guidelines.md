# 8fold Fold System Guidelines

Effective July 23, 2017

8fold Productivity ("8fold") has a point system to handle multiple aspects of traditional business functions. Each point is called a Fold.

Folds cannot be redeemed for, traded in for, nor converted to cash or cash equivalents. Any member, or group of members, discovered doing so will be subject to removal from 8fold and disqualified from future membership. 8fold cannot be held liable for members attempting to trade Folds for cash or cash equivalents.

To bring levity to an otherwise serious matter: Don't be that person. It's not worth it to you or 8fold.

## Earning Folds

There are many ways to earn Folds, some of which are listed below:

- Paying the monthly membership fee.
- Monetarily contributing directly to 8fold beyond the monthly membership fee.
- One member transferring Folds from themselves to you.
- Invoicing client work (practitioners only).
- Completing tasks required by 8fold (practitioners only).

Note: A member cannot earn more than 20,000 Folds from monetary contributions within a given calendar year. Further, 8fold will not accept monetary contributions from a single member totaling more than $20,000 per calendar year.

## Membership levels

|Level   |Folds         |Reimbursable |Decays |
|-------:|:-------------|:-----------:|:-----:|
|None    |0 to 599      |no           |no     |
|Quarter |600 to 1199   |yes          |yes    |
|Half    |1200 to 2399  |yes          |yes    |
|Full    |2400 to 4799  |yes          |yes    |
|Double  |4800 to 9599  |yes          |yes    |
|Quad    |9600 to 19999 |yes          |yes    |
|Oct     |20000+        |yes          |yes    |

## Reimbursement

Every quarter, 8fold performs a financial review. If a net profit is demonstrated, a reimbursement is distributed to 8fold members based on membership level.

Who's ready for some math!

Let's say 8fold generates a net profit of $10,000. There are four members:

1. John is a Quarter member.
2. Suzy is a Full member.
3. Jose is a Double member.
4. Gita is an Oct member.

What we want to do now is determine how much one Full reimbursement is by dividing the net profit by the reimbursements present:

- Quarter: 0.25
- Full: 1
- Double: 2
- Oct: 8
- **Total:** 11.25

The amount for one Full member reimbursement would be, $888 ($10,000/11.25 - rounding down to the nearest dollar). This would result in the reimbursement amounts listed in the following table.

|Member |Level   |Multiplier |Reimbursement amount |
|:------|:------:|----------:|:--------------------|
|John   |Quarter |0.25       |$222                 |
|Suzy   |Full    |1          |$888                 |
|Jose   |Double  |2          |$1776                |
|Gita   |Oct     |8          |$7104                |

Note: This results in $10 being unclaimed from the net profit, which will be rolled into the following reimbursement cycle.

## How net profit is demonstrated

As with most things at 8fold, we want to describe not only the what, but the why behind the decisions that are made. With that said, the following describes how the profit pool to be shared is calculated.

1. **If 8fold has debt, net profit is not demonstrated.** If money is owed to someone, 8fold is “in the red”; therefore, not profitable.
2. **If 8fold does not have a reserve of three times its average monthly expenses, net profit is not demonstrated.** Because the average monthly expenses for 8fold can change, choosing a static monetary reserve amount (ex. $5,000) is not a viable long-term calculation method. Further, if members and practitioners manage to keep operating expenses low, the easier it is to demonstrate a net profit.
3. **If a net profit cannot be demonstrated, the decay rate does not apply.** The fact that 8fold is in debt or does not have enough in reserve should not impact members and practitioners who contribute their time, energy, and income to support 8fold and its mission.

If all of the above are in place and 8fold can even consider executing on its promise of sharing profits, the question is, how will the pool be determined. 8fold will take the balance *beyond* the reserve, deduct the estimated expenses for the following quarter, and what remains is the profit pool from which to complete the distribution. For example, Quarter 1 to Quarter 2:

1. Balance: $10,000
2. Debt: $0
3. Reserve: $3,000
4. Estimate Q2 expenses: $3,000
5. Profit pool: $4,000 (used in aforementioned reimbursement calculations)

## Decay rates

Each membership level from Quarter to Oct is subject to a decay rate. Let's say you are an Oct member, meaning you have over 20,000 Folds and you cancel your 8fold membership. 

How long would it take for you to no longer receive reimbursements?

|Starting membership level |Ending membership level |Months taken to decay |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------------------|
|Oct                       |Quad                    |1                     |
|Quad                      |Double                  |3                     |
|Double                    |Full                    |6                     |
|Full                      |Half                    |8                     |
|Half                      |Quarter                 |10                    |
|Quarter                   |None                    |12                    |
|**Total**                 |                        |**40**                |

Therefore, if you make the highest allowable annual financial contribution of $20,000 and then do nothing else, you will qualify for and receive reimbursement for just over three years.
