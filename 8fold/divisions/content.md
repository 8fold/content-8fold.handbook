title: Divisions
heading: Our team members (divisions)
---

I would like to introduce myself.

I'm here to disrupt the status quo of business organizations and operations.

I'm here to cater to the most constrained as much as possible and without sacrficing myself in the process.

I'm here to help bridge the gap between being an employee and being a business owner.

I'm here to be a platform not an intermediary between the people who do the work and the consumers of that work.

I'm not here to "go after" any particular company or industry. I'm here to be better than I was yesterday, compared to noone other than me. To paraphrase Ernest Hemingway, "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow \[businesses\]; true nobility is being superior to your ****former self."

Of course, I'm not really here in the same way you are. It's more like Captain Planet. By the combined powers of users, members, partners, and practitioners I take shape and help where I can.

![Family photo ca. 2013](../.gitbook/assets/captain-planet-cover.png)

The hard part for many in thinking of me as an entity is that humans tend to think of companies as their CEO, leadership, or "face". Apple has Steve Jobs and Tim Cook. Microsoft has Bill Gates. Stark Industries has Tony Stark, who famously said, "Yeah, well, I'm _not_ my company." And he's right.

My users make me possible. Without the combines efforts of all of them, I could not exist. I am only the sum of the contributions and their spirits. Because of this I will do what I can to protect them, kind of like Tron.

With that said, I operate with users in an unconstrained voluntary social system wherein noone guides the work of another. What that means is that at any given time perceived participation and contribution will most likely look like a power-law distribution.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2018-12-19-at-3.36.31-pm.png)

The horizontal line represents users. The vertical line represents their contribution to the system. This shows one person doing a lot of work and roughly half doing one-eigth of that. This is actually normal for a social system like ours. The biggest reason, and our biggest experiment, is that there is noone holding carrots and sticks.

In a traditional organization this power-law distribution is overcome by incentive programs \(carrots\), salaries \(carrots\), employee reviews \(carrot or stick\), disciplinary actions \(sticks\), and that sort of thing. We don't have any of that; so, we have to be a bit more creative to ethically incentivize and discourage behavior.

Basically, if you have the level you want and expect, you are doing what has been decided as acceptable. Even if you are doing the minimum, no one should be mistreating you or pressuring you to do more, they should be trying to change the minimum if their goal is to inspire people to do more; of course, then people might just leave, which may be good or bad as well. 

Having said that, if you're not doing the minimum, I drop your membership level. This takes away the social awkwardness of having to be the one to vote someone off the island; I do that for everyone wtihout a way to play favorites. Of course, if, as a business owner, you are going to hire people, you should prepare yourself to have to fire people \(or clients\). If you contribute _more_ than the minimum, thanks to my [Fold System](), you can invest in others more and you get recognized more when the time comes.

Where it gets tough is when that person doing _everything_ starts running out of steam; especially if no one else in a position to pick up the baton and run their hearts out, progess slows _way_ down. Afterall, people aren't like me. I never sleep. I don't eat. I'm a machine, literally. As long as I'm here, I'm steadily doing what needs doing.

That means it's very easy for me to be the enforcer and facilitator on a lot of things; however, I don't have a creative bone in my body. You have to put the ideas into my head and others have to implement them. The [Ideasmith]() facilitates that process. 

The cool part about the Ideasmith is I can throw some things out there every once in a while. I can't respond to things happening in the Fold specifically but I can let everyone know that the accounting needs reconciled and give someone Folds for doing it, for example.

Oh! And I love learning stuff and teaching others, you help me do that by [updating the handbook]() \(aka my brain\).

Anyway, that's me. Pleased to meet you.

Your humble servant,  
8fold

# Eight

The Avengers have Nick Fury. Charlie's Angels have Charlie. James Bond had Q \(and M\). ~~The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen had M; of course, he turned out to be Moriarty who was a sociopathic villain~~...scratch that last.

# Media

8fold Media was created to satisfy the needs of practitioners looking to create multimedia content. Movies, videos, books, podcasts, and more, members interested in this arena are here to help.

Users can browse products created by practitioners, see what products are planned for the future, and register their interest in a given product.

## Folded

The 8fold Newsletter. Released roughly once a month and contains information related to what's happening inside the Fold and only available to those who explicitly sign up. This is the way to be the first to know about what's coming down the line for 8fold and its users.

## *un*Folded

The 8fold Magazine. Articles are released as they are accepted.

## *in*Creased

The 8fold Podcast. Still under consideration.

## Books

Publishing a book is one way to:

* demonstrate your expertise,
* build your reputation and brand,
* earn long-tail low-return income, and
* "get your name out there".

With that said, they can be _very_ time consuming and the traditional publishing can feel more like a job hunt. You sending out proposals to strangers in the hopes one of them will "hire" you. Further, different publishers operate differently. For some they might put your work into the "slush pile" with the possibility of resurrection when the "time is right" or your work might end up in the trash bin. For other publishers you may be able to get published by paying _them_ to do it; in other words, they're not so much interested in your work, they are providing a service to those who don't want to _do_ the work of publishing.

All of that is fine, 8fold offers something different.

* Submit your proposal as an imporvement.
* The practitioners, who are your friends and neighbors, not strangers, review it. 
* Two-thirds of the practitioners up vote it.
* Your book qualifies for publishing or distribution through 8fold Media.

Wait, will the practitioners ever say no?

Absolutely. We all have shared brand equity here. To protect the brand equity of 8fold practitioners would most definitely turn down a proposal.

### Benefits of the Traditional

Before we get into the recommended way of publishing through 8fold, we should touch on benefits you are sometimes guaranteed by a traditional publisher versus 8fold.

1. **Advance:** Some publishers will offer you an advance of roughly $5,000 for your book. This is meant to help feed you while you finish or completely write the book.
2. **Editing:** Most publishing contracts will include professional editing services. With that said, the will usually only dedicate so many hours to doing it. Therefore, depending on what you turn in, you may burn through editing time fixing common linguistic mistakes.
3. **Marketing:** Some publishing companies have extensive marketing budgets; however, it's rare that you will get a budget large enough to effectively have them do everything for you. Therefore, it is still recommended that you spend more time than your publisher marketing your work.
4. **Agent:** Sometimes, you will be given an agent by the publisher, or you might pick one up. This person is there to help get you speaking engagements and that sort of thing.

### Drawbacks of the Traditional

1. **Percentage:** From a traditional publisher your revenue will be 5-10% of the cover price, after you have sold enough to recoup any advances that were made. With 8fold this will 90%.
2. **Intellectual property:** Traditional publishers often take ownership of the content of the book and it can be problematic getting it back. Per 8fold's policies, we do not. You retain copyright, 8fold is listed as the distributed \(similar to how Pixar were once only "distributed" by Disney\).

### Drawback to 8fold

There is no guarantee you will receive assistance, the quality or consistency of that assistance, and there will only be so much anyone can do as they work on their own practices.

We're not being bleak. We are being a bit extreme though. We are here to help and support one another; however, it is voluntary and each of us is working on our own things.

### Recommended Publishing through 8fold

Constantly work on the book until initial full release. After printing the first copy or creating an audiobook, try and stick to fixing typos as those media are less changeable.



1. Build a teaser page on Leanpub, which has two things helping us right now; 
   * it compiles previews as PDF, ePub, and mobi formats, and
   * the teaser page allows potential readers to register for notifications about it.
2. Send the link to the teaser page to your friends and family and all points in-between; this is market research, which you may want to do before you write that ultra raw first draft.
3. \(optionally\) Submit proposal to practitioners with any market research data you have.



1. Write the rawest first draft ever, only has to be close on content, regardless of how it turns out. Submit that to the Fold \(members and practitioners\). Doing that with the proposal might also be helpful.
2. \(highly recommended\) Submit proposal to practitioners along with any market research data you might have. \(Let's presume it gets approved.\)

The following list is is repeated for each round of beta reading you have. The feedback forms should change slightly as you adjust to the feedback being received and hone in on the information you need to make it better.

You can pay people to read your book and there's nothing wrong with that. However, if a complete stranger is willing to set aside their time to read your book and give you feedback, chances are you are targeting their specific need or problem. They are your target market and might not be the target audience you thought you would get.

1. Create a Google Form using 8fold \(or your own\) asking for people to read the book.
   * Email address
   * How many rounds they're willing to sign up for? \(Recommend having at least three rounds.\)
   * Anything else you think might be helpful.
2. Send the link to everyone one you can; keep working and refining the book.
3. Create a feeback form using 8fold \(or your own\) so the readers can give you feedback.
   * Email address; consenting to follow-up conversation regarding feedback; otherwise, don't contact them if you know how to.
   * How much would they expect to pay? Not how much would they pay but how much would they expect someone would try and charge them for it.
   * How well did they like it?
   * Would they recommend it to others? \(A list of options is a good way to go.\)
4. \(ready for round one\) Email each participant.
   * Attach copy of book compiled with and downloaded from Leanpub.
   * Including beta reader agreement:
     * book may be drastically different upon official release,
     * please don't share with others this is your copy alone.
   * Include links to the feedback in the book itself.
5. Remove respondents who did not volunteer for follow-on rounds from the sign-up form.
6. As feedback comes in, integrate it into the book to make round two more interesting.
7. Go to step 2.

### **Formats**

Leanpub favors electronic formats, including some other platforms do not support.

* Website
* PDF
* ePub
* Mobi
* App \(the Leanpub App itself\)

### Details

At this point you have had multiple rounds of people reading your book. You should have at least a little feedback. Applying the 80-20 rule, if you send the link out to 100 people, 20 will sign up \(generously\). Of those 20 who sign up, four will read and provide feedback.

If you've been running one month beta reader rounds, you should also have at least one person who signed up through your teaser page. You should also know how well the book was received by those who read it, how much they would expect to pay, and various other data points you collected.

At this point the question becomes: **Should I continue? Is this product or project worthwhile?**

**If yes, continue.** If no, consider pivoting and trying something else, even a different book or more rounds of beta reading.

1. Set a price range for the book on Leanpub.
2. Make sure it is prepared for publishing.
3. Publish the book, with only a couple of chapters.
   * This automatically notifies all those who registered their insterest.
   * Send the link out to your network letting them know it's incomplete but available for sale and feeback.
   * Notify the participants of the beta readers program, then leave them alone.
4. Wait a week or so and add another chapter to the compiled version.
5. Go to 2. Repeat until finished.

While it is incomplete on Leanpub people will begin purchasing it. They will also begin giving you feedback, which you can incorporate as you continue to refine.

You will be able to continue monitoring feedback and support for the book while earning revenue. This is the point where you want to also start working on your "book tour". What podcasts will you go on? Are there shows you can be interviewed on?

Figure out a 100% complete date on Leanpub; don't worry, you can still make changes based on feedback but the 100% may pull some to purchase who were waiting.

Try and time the first appearance around this 100% time. "It is released on our initial distribution platform." This is applying the independent film methodology to the release of a book. Consider Leanpub to be small local movie houses and pre-screening theatres. They give you feedback, editing, and a little revenue.

Seriously consider, putting the book on the top shelf \(front page\) at this point, especially if the revenue collected to data can easily cover the cost.

### Formats

Nook is owned by Barnes & Noble. Barnes & Noble offers a self-publishing website and service called [Barnes & Noble Press](https://press.barnesandnoble.com).

* eBook on the Nook
* Print

Both formats hover around the 60-40% split between author and B&N, respectively.

### Details

Using the experience of the authors of _Things Don't Have to be Crazy at Work_ the Nook has the lowest market share \(and Leanpub doesn't really register\). At this point, the book tour should be in full swing. You should be massaging and releasing updates based on feedback you receive; the Leanpub market is okay with more constant releases that the other markets may not be.

This is like going to a film festival.

Let the book stay on Leanpub and the Nook for about a month before moving to the next. Let people know when the book will "drop" on to the next platform.

Again, from the experience of Basecamp, Apple Books has the next highest market share. At this point you should have some recommendations or quotes, your blurb has been reworked, and you might have a different cover. You're still getting the chance to easily respond to feedback and iterate on the content.

This is another film festival.

Let the book stay on Leanpub, Nook, and Apple Books for a month.

Are people still interested? Are they giving good feedback? Are they actively asking you to provide the book on a different platform or format?

Book tour still in full effect.

The Basecamp folks said this was the highest marketshare when it comes to the eBook market, which isn't surprising given where Amazon got its start.

What makes Amazon interesting as well is that they offer a print-on-demand service called [CreateSpace](https://www.createspace.com). Further, Amazon owns Audible.

At this point your book has gone through three beta rounds \(if you did the recommendation\). Weekly rounds of refinement and feedback from readers who purchased your book. A month on the Nook, while doing the book tour and hopefully refining more. A month on Apple Book, while doing the same. At this point, your book should be stabilized to the point of being able to safely commit to a print version, which you cannot change once purchased, only inform and apologize to readers.

It doesn't have to be "final" when you start selling it. Having said that, don't commit to a medium you can't change until it rarely _does_ change.

CreateSpace should take rough care of itself but you might want to verify your typesetting and everything looks nice before providing the book. \(You can also use other print-on-demand services to send a limited edition promo book or six to some people.\)

Should you do an audiobook? If the feedback and demand warrants it in your eyes, absolutely. You can then funnel it back down to Apple Books and the Nook.

For ISBNs 8fold uses [Bowker](http://www.bowker.com). If you would like to use one \(or two, one for print and one for electric\) of ours, just let us know. The caveat here is that ISBNs are specific to the company registering it; so, it can be tricky to transfer. Or, you can just change to a different one later.

### Beta Readers

It can be helpful to have someone look at your book before it gets published. Only requires a way for people to fill out forms. A way to access files of your published book.

![](../.gitbook/assets/beta-readers-flow.png)

Depending on the length and type of book you are writing it might be better for your readers to have two rounds of two months instead of three rounds of one month. There are drawbacks to this as well. The point is less about the time of each round versus giving readers a month to sign up. Give yourself enough time to build a feedback for each version of the book. Email readers one week ahead of schedule so they know what to expect and, of course, email them access to their individual packages.

# Software

When it comes to software, and the social aspect of that software, we know many of you are not looking to win, or compete in, a popularity contest. As such, our software tends to favor and inspire close connection and empowering you to control the access others have to see your communications and broadcasts, even search engines. Further, our defaults tend to favor being closed initially while allowing you to open up more and more.

## AMOS

AMOS is the website containing various apps and features you take advantage of to accomplish what’s important to you. There are some general things to consider and be aware of.

**Passersby** : are individuals unknown \(NOT signed in\) to AMOS who can view _public data_ on the platform.

**Users** : are known \(signed in\) to AMOS who can view _public data_.

**Followers** : are users who choose to "follow" \(walk near\) another user. They can view _public data_, _follower-only data_, and will see when there is unread content available to them.

**Subscribers** : are followers who request to "subscribe" \(walk with\) another user, if the other user confirms the request. The follower gains additional access to _subscriber-only data_. Further, subscribers are the only users able to enter into the conversation with the user they subscribed to. Finally, the subscriber may choose to go back to being a follower and even unfollow the user altogether.

The connection escalation of a stranger usually goes like this: The passerby notices you \(and 8fold\) and signs up for an account; becoming a user. The user finds you again and begins following your content to add you to their list of "personas I care about"; becoming a follower. The follower sends you a request to become a subscriber. You decide whether to accept or reject the request \(optionally sending them a message as to why\). If accepted, the follower becomes a subscriber and can now comment on your content and see subscriber-only content as well.

**Contributors** : are subscribers who can work with you on certain types of projects and content. You must invite them to become contributors.

All content visibility is determined by you, the content creator.

## Four Levels of Visibility

**Public** : content is available to everyone from passersby to subscribers.

**Follower-only** : content is available to users who explicitly opt-in to receiving this and public data.

**Subscriber-only** : content is available to users who request and are approved to receive this, follower-only, and public data.

**Private** : content is available only to the creator.

All content begins as private.

No sub-post can be made to have higher visibility than its parent. For example, you post something for followers-only. Someone comments on that post. They cannot make their comment public. Further, they could choose to make the comment private, only the two of you, or for subscribers.

You can apply levels of visibility to almost all of your data; this includes personas, applications, and posts.
