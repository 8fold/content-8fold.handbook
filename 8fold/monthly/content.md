8fold has one recurring meeting. Attendance is not required.

At this event attendees discuss how they're doing in their endeavors and other topics. Anyone who can attend may contribute to the agenda. Decisions that can't be achieved elsewhere, happen here. 

Optional attendance means decisions might be made you don't agree with. Further, those decisions may change at anytime as new information surfaces.
