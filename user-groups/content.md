title: User groups
---

8fold recognizes four groups of humans interacting with and operating within it.

1. [Users](#users)
2. [Members](#members)
3. [Partners](#partners)
4. [Practitioners](#practitioners)

Each subsequent group is a part of the preceding group - think of the concentric circular layers of an onion. As such, all practitioners are users, but not all users are practitioners.

## Users \(or Customers\)

Users can be divided into unauthenticated and authenticated. When unauthenticated, you are treated as a stranger to 8fold. When authenticated, the system knows you enough to differentiate you from an unauthenticated user, member, partner, or practitioner.

Becoming a user of 8fold requires:

* visiting a website owned and operated by 8fold, or
* purchasing products and services from a practitioner,
* carrying the 8fold brand, or
* registering with the [8fold Platform](https://8fold.software/), _and_
* agreeing to the [Privacy](../policy-palace/privacy-agreement.md) and [Service](../policy-palace/service-agreement.md) Agreements.

Users are empowered to:

* provide feedback,
* purchase products & services, and
* solicit information from practitioners.

## Members

Members want to support 8fold a bit more than a user.

Becoming a member of 8fold requires:

* becoming a [user](users.md),
* registering with the [8fold platform](https://8fold.pro), and
* agreeing to the [Membership Agreement](../policy-palace/membership-agreement.md).

8fold is a contribution-based voluntary coalition; therefore, to remain a member you must earn the minimum [Folds](../the-inner-fold/eight/fold-system/) per month for the desired membership level. 

If the minimum isn't earned, 8fold will attempt to notify you. 8fold then gives you one month to earn the required Folds. If the minimum has not been earned by the end of that month, 8fold converts your account to the closest account type you qualify for; for example, a practitioner who earns five Folds would be converted to a member.

{% hint style="info" %}
Members are able to:

* do everything a user can,
* access [the 8fold Ideasmith](members.md) to offer insight and feedback,
* access the 8fold Platform,
* qualify for discounts on 8fold software,
* earn Folds by contributing time and money,
* trade Folds with others, and
* qualify for [profit redistribution](members.md).

Members are required to [**earn 5 Folds per month**](members.md).
{% endhint %}

## Partners

Partners are Members wanting to contribute a bit more than a member. Partners are typically, but not always, displayed as the business owned by the member, not themselves. This acts as promotional material for their business.

Becoming a partner of 8fold requires:

* becoming a [member of 8fold](members.md), and
* agreeing to the [Partnership Agreement](../policy-palace/partnership-agreement.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Partners are able to:

* do everything a member can,
* attend the monthly event to offer insight and feedback,
* be billed once per year for all domains registered using 8fold,
* free website hosting using our hosting provider**,
* access the 8fold group chat,
* access 8fold Google Drive and materials, and
* establish a mini-profile \(card\) on the partner page of the 8fold Professionals site.

Partners are required to **earn 25 Folds per month**.

_\*\* Depends on site size and traffic; however, chances are your hosting will be free._
{% endhint %}

## Practitioners

Practitioners are "all in," so to speak. They are partners, members, _and_ users and would like to help 8fold thrive while potentially receiving more in return by way of promotion, access, and the ability to work under, alongside, or without the 8fold brand.

Becoming a practitioner of 8fold requires:

* becoming a [partner](../partners.md),
* agreeing to the [Practitioner Agreement](../../policy-palace/practitioner-agreement.md), and
* going through the [Onboarding Process](becoming-a-practitioner/README.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Practitioners are able to:

* do everything a Partner can,
* have an 8fold.pro email address with G Suite account,
* have a full promotional profile page on [8fold.pro](https://8fold.pro),
* be showcased in the 8fold Newsletter,
* access Zoom to hold video conferences,
* take advantage of the 8fold Mailchimp account and list\(s\),
* operate as a non-legal representative of 8fold,
* attend events beyond the monthly,
* vote on changes to 8fold, and
* qualify for group discount and MTO status from ICAgile.

Practitioners are required to **earn 50 Folds per month**.

{% endhint %}

As practitioners can operate under and on behalf of 8fold itself, please see the [practitioners area](/practitioners) of the handbook for more information and resources.
