title: User groups
---

8fold recognizes four groups of humans interacting with and operating within it.

1. [Users](#users-or-customers)
2. [Members](#members)
3. [Partners](#partners)
4. [Practitioners](#practitioners)

Each subsequent group is a part of the preceding group - think of the concentric circular layers of an onion. As such, all practitioners are users, but not all users are practitioners.

## Users (or Customers)

Users can be divided into unauthenticated and authenticated. When unauthenticated, you are treated as a stranger to 8fold. When authenticated, the system knows you enough to differentiate you from an unauthenticated user, member, partner, or practitioner.

<details>
	<summary>Becoming an 8fold user</summary>
	<p>You are considered an 8fold user by performing any of the following:</p>
	<ul>

	<summary>User empowerment</summary>
	<p>Users are empowered to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>provide feedback,</li>
		<li>purchase products & services, and</li>
		<li>solicit information from practitioners.</li>
	</ul>
</details>

## Members

Members want to support 8fold a bit more than a user.

<details>

	</ul>
	<p>Note on Folds: If the minimum isn't earned, 8fold attempts to notify you and gives you one month to earn the Folds. If the minimum has not been earned by the end of that month, 8fold converts your account to the closest account type you qualify for; for example, a practitioner who earns five Folds would be converted to a member.</p>

## Partners

Partners are Members wanting to contribute a bit more than a member. Partners are typically, but not always, displayed as the business owned by the member, not themselves. This acts as promotional material for their business.

	</ul>
</details>


## Practitioners

Practitioners are "all in," so to speak. They are partners, members, *and* users and would like to help 8fold thrive while potentially receiving more in return by way of promotion, access, and the ability to work under, alongside, or without the 8fold brand.
