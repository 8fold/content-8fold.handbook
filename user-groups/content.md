title: User groups
---

8fold recognizes five groups of humans interacting with and operating within it.

1. [Visitors](#visitors)
2. [Registered Users](#registered-known-users)
3. [Members](#members)
4. [Partners](#partners)
5. [Practitioners](#practitioners)

Each subsequent group is a part of the preceding group - think of the concentric circular layers of an onion. As such, all practitioners are users, but not all users are practitioners.

## Visitors

A stranger or someone unknown to 8fold who is visiting our physical and digital spaces who agrees to the Visitor [User Agreement](/user-agreements).

Visitors may purchase products as a guest and receive services in which no information is collected or stored. Visitors may also offer 8fold feedback on ways to improve and request information from Practitioners about 8fold.

## Registered, known Users

Registered Users are Visitors who agree to the Registered [User Agreement](/user-agreements).

They are "known" to 8fold in that information has been collected and stored specifically about them. (Usually an email address.)
