# Your Practice

8fold caters to [micro-businesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-enterprise) and those maybe looking to start a business but not sure they're willing to take the risk. As such, there are some recommendations we tend to repeatedly make.

1. [You are not Your Company](you-are-not-your-company.md)
2. [Prioritize your Diversity](prioritized-diversity.md)

Chances are your practice will fit primarily into one of the following categories;

1. **Product Development:** You will create, sell, or distribute a product. Be it software or hardware.
2. **Content Generation:** You will create, sell, or distribute content for consumption by others. Could be books, articles, videos, and so on.
3. **Professional Services:** If product and content development is creating something _from_ yourself to be consumed by others without you, professional services is offering yourself to others to be consumed (odd as that might sound). In other words, you are the product. Further, if you are providing the service to someone to help build a product or content, you are providing a professional service because your goal is not to create your own thing but to help someone else create *their* thing.

Technically, each of these are product development depending on how one defines "product". Therefore, it's important to define terms:

1. **Product:** An article or substance that is manufactured or refined for sale (not the generic "a thing or person that is the result of an action or process").
2. **Services:** This is delegation by the customer to someone else to complete work ("the action of helping or doing work for someone").

There is a lot of overlap in these business types, which will typically result in an overlap in what you create for yourself and others. 

Let's say you develop a piece of software (product) with a user guide (content) and charge for phone support (services). You cover all three categories.

Every category will have various characteristics, which include:

- Prerequisites.
- Primary purpose.
- Return level.
- Return length.
- Maintenance cost.

When it comes to professional services, there are multiple agreement types:

1. W2-permanent: This is traditional employment. Withholds taxes and usually provides benefits.
2. W2-contract: This is contracted labor and the company who hired you withholds taxes and does *not* provide benefits.
3. 1099: You, as an individual, are brought on for a period of time to perform work. Taxes are *not* withheld and benefits are usually *not* provided. This also tends to increase your personal liability and risk.
4. Corp-to-Corp: This is a company hiring another company to find people to perform work. It is the business equivalent of 1099. Corporation A does not withhold nor provide benefit savings to Corporation B. Corporation B may or may not do the same for those doing the work.

In most cases, 8fold operates with 1099 and corp-to-corp agreements when it comes to practitioners.

It's important to note that, when it comes to contracts, the farther from the client you are, the less you will most likely get paid. For example, Client A may get charged $100 for your services. Contractor A may keep 20% and pay Consultancy A $80 per hour for your services. You may be a 1099 with Consultancy A who also keeps 20%, which means you get paid $64 per hour. Further, there may be a recruiter involved who will keep a bit as well, resulting in you getting paid $50 per hour. Of course, you didn't have to do any of the work finding the client either.

Determining your rate is part math and mostly voodoo. The math as has been recommended goes like this:

1. Take your annual salary and divide by 2,000: Skip if you're already on an hourly rate.
2. Multiply the result from 1 by anywhere from 1.25 to 2.5.

A more detailed approach would take into account more of your life and goals and not just a rate. For example, I use a rate calculator I built for myself. It allows me to change all sorts of numbers:

1. The hourly rate, which is multiplied by 2,000 and reduced by 30% to account for taxes, which rarely go beyond 50%.
2. Total cost of student loans per month.
3. Flat 8fold fees.
4. Monthly rent, if I'd be relocating.
5. Monthly cash allowance; spending money for various things like dining out.
6. Monthly food allowance.
7. Monthly medical expenses (you can get benefits without an employer).
8. Monthly phone costs.
9. Monthly internet costs.
10. Monthly estimated utility costs.
11. Annual learning and growth budget.
12. 8fold 10%.

This spreadsheet allows me to quickly analyze and see where I could adjust. I've had a recruiter tell me that they could pay $50 per hour. Then I went to the location of the client and looked at nearby apartments. My calculations ended with needing to make $65 per hour. That would have been a lot better than thinking I was in a good place with $100,000 as an annual (gross) salary.
