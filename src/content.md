# 8fold Handbook

8fold is a platform organization for micro-businesses. We celebrate the individual while catering to the most constrained.

As a network of independent business owners cooperating and creating a variety of products and services, this handbook stores learnings to help improve us all. This handbook can also guide a stranger to effectively run 8fold or create their own 8fold-like organization.

8fold and its divisions are treated and references as people. (Like the Avengers with less danger to the world and less drama.)

At the highest level, 8fold is the sum total of a [documented culture](/8fold/culture), [basics of operation](/8fold), and one [monthly event](/8fold/monthly).

8fold is comprised of four [divisions](/divisions):

* Pro: Firmly believes in the power of compassionate service and maintains a curated list of professionals offering products and services to 8fold users.
* Media: The voice of The Fold using whatever she deems appropriate from blogs to books, podcasts to emails, and back again.
* Dev: The keeper of code and keys behind software development across 8fold.
* Link: Keeping The Fold connected.

If you're looking to connect with others, talk to [Link](https://8fold.link). If you're looking for a tool to do-it-yourself, talk to [Dev](https://8fold.dev). If you want to hear what 8fold, as a collective, is up to, listen to [Media](https://8fold.media). If you want to hire a professional to help you and those in your charge, see [Pro](https://8fold.pro).

8fold interacts with four [user groups](/user-groups) wherein each subsequent group is part of the preceding group, but not vice versa:

1. Users are the outermost circle and these individuals purchase and trade products and services with one other.
2. Members _are_ users supporting 8fold and its practitioners by earning Folds every month.
3. Partners _are_ members who support 8fold and its practitioners earning Folds every month, which gives them the ability to promote themselves on the 8fold partner page.
4. Practitioners _are_ partners who offer products and services to users and can do so under the name of 8fold.

All users must agree to the terms of our [service agreement](/legal/service-agreement), [privacy agreement](/legal/privacy-agreement), [user agreements](/legal/user-agreements), and comply with other [policies](/legal/policies).

All members are able to take advantage of 8fold's [fold-system](/fold-system) and other benefits.

## Legal Representation

8fold, llc \(8fold from here on\) is a limited liability corporation registered in the State of Tennessee, USA and governed by the laws of that state.

While legally a limited liability, for profit corporation, 8fold operates more like a self-organizing, self-managing voluntary not-for-profit coalition.

It provides a comfortable place to help individuals stretch into the discomfort of owning, operating, and right-sizing a business. The hope from being a coalition is that your passions make up for the dispassions of others and vice versa.
