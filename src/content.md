# 8fold Handbook

8fold is platform organizations for micro-businesses catering to the most constrained and celebrating the individual.

As a network of business owners operating different businesses in a variety of ways, this handbook stores learnings to help improve us all.

Further, this handbook attempts to guide a stranger coming in to effectively run 8fold should that be required.

We treat and reference 8fold, and its divisions, as people. Like the Avengers with less danger to the world and less drama.

At the highest level, 8fold is the sum of a [documented culture](/8fold/culture), [basics of operation](/8fold), and one [monthly event](/8fold/monthly).

8fold is comprised of four [divisions](/divisions):

* Pro: I maintain a curated list of professionals offering products and services to 8fold users. These products and services include health & wellness, self-management, software development, and more. Pro firmly believes in the power of compassionate service.
* Media: I the voice of The Fold using whatever she deems appropriate from blogs to books, podcasts to emails, and back again.
* Dev: I am the keeper fo the code and keys behind software development throughout 8fold.
* Link: I keep everyone in The Fold connected.

If you're looking to connect with others, talk to Link. If you're looking for a tool to do-it-yourself, talk to Dev. If you want to hear what 8fold, as a collective, is up to, listen to Media. If you want to hire a professional to help you and those in your charge, see Pro.

8fold interacts with four [user groups](/user-groups) wherein each subsequent group is part of the preceding group, but not vice versa:

1. Users are the outermost circle and these individuals purchase and trade products and services with one other.
2. Members _are_ users supporting 8fold and its practitioners by earning Folds every month.
3. Partners _are_ members who support 8fold and its practitioners earning Folds every month, which gives them the ability to promote themselves on the 8fold partner page.
4. Practitioners _are_ partners who offer products and services to users and can do so under the name of 8fold.

All users must agree to the terms of our [service agreement](/legal/service-agreement), [privacy agreement](/legal/privacy-agreement), [user agreements](/legal/user-agreements), and comply with other [policies](/legal/policies).

All members are able to take advantage of 8fold's [fold-system](/fold-system) and other benefits.

## Legal Representation

8fold, llc \(8fold from here on\) is a limited liability corporation registered in the State of Tennessee, USA and governed by the laws of that state.

While legally a limited liability, for profit corporation, 8fold operates more like a self-organizing, self-managing voluntary not-for-profit coalition.

It provides a comfortable place to help individuals stretch into the discomfort of owning, operating, and right-sizing a business. The hope from being a coalition is that your passions make up for the dispassions of others and vice versa.
