Privacy is important. The 8fold Privacy Agreement was developed with the same mindset as our products and services: Would we want to do business with us?

This policy sets out our privacy practices and explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit and use our sites, services, products, and content ("Services").

## What we may collect

Information you send us and referral information may be tied directly to you as a user. When you use 8fold Services or contact us, we may use third-party applications and services. Those services and 8fold may use this information to fight spam and other abuses; to personalize 8fold Services; or to aggregate non-identifying information about how people use 8fold Services.

Quick definitions:

- **Collect:** In this context, collection is what we receive a piece of data related to your use of the Services.
- **Store:** In this context, storage is when we save collected information persistently. If the information stored is modified or obfuscated in some way, we will tell you how at a high level. This obfuscation may include and is not limited to [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption), [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function), or both.

The following sections describe what data is collected, stored, or both, under what circumanstances, and what third-party services we may use.

When you sign up for an account with 8fold Link you are consenting to receive [messages from 8fold](#messages-from-8fold). Specifically, the messages are administrative in nature to include changes in policy and release notes of the 8fold Link platform.

As such, we will collect and store an obfuscated version of **at least one email address**.

In order to comply with our own principles and the [anti-spam policy of our host](https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/anti-spam-policy/), we do the following:

1. Use a confirmation mechanism: We send you a one-time message asking you to confirm you wish to continue receiving messages. Until confirmation is received, that will be the only message we send. The message will contain:
	- a brief description of what you're signing up for,
	- a URL leading your to this privacy agreement, and
	- a URL to confirm your desire to receive further messages.
2. When you follow the confirmation URL, we collect and store the following per the identified policies and procedures:
	- the IP address used when confirming, per our host's policies and procedures;
	- the date and time of confirmation, per our and our host's policies and procedures.

|+ ### Site usage tracking
When tracking is enabled on 8fold sites, we collect only information needed to differentiate humans and web crawlers, what pages were visited, and when; specifically:

1. a system-developed session identifier,
2. the current [.URL](uniform resource locator) the session is associated with,
3. the URL from which the session arrived at the current URL, and
4. the time the session arrived at the current URL using our server clocks.

These data are collected to help gain insight how users are traversing the sites, how long they are staying, where they came from (referrers), and the number of sessions (not individuals) are doing so.

We **do not** collect or store:

1. your IP Address,
2. your location,
3. browser and other client information (including browsing history), or
4. any known personal information that can be used atomically or in aggregate that may identify a living person.

## Messages from 8fold

Sometimes we send administrative messages (usually in the form of email) about account or service changes, new policies, and software release notes (not marketing materials).

> Unsubscribing from these messages is classified as a request to delete your account with 8fold Link.

We will *never* ask you for your password or other account information via these messages. If you receive such an email, send it to us so we can investigate further.

## Disclosure of your information

As a rule, we do not share your personal information outside of 8fold.

We will not sell your information.

We may share your personal information with third parties in limited circumstances, including: 

1. with your consent; 
2. to a vendor or partner who meets our data protection standards in order to help facilitate a feature you requested access to; or 
3. when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.

If we're going to share your information in response to legal processes, we will attempt to give you advance notice so you can challenge it (for example, by seeking intervention from the courts), unless we're prohibited by law or court order. We will object to requests for information about users of our Services we believe to be improper.

If we merge with another company such that your information becomes subject to a different privay policy, we will notify you prior to such a transfer. You can opt-out of the new policy by deleting your account during the notice period.
