# Software

When it comes to software, and the social aspect of that software, we know many of you are not looking to win, or compete in, a popularity contest. As such, our software tends to favor and inspire close connection and empowering you to control the access others have to see your communications and broadcasts, even search engines. Further, our defaults tend to favor being closed initially while allowing you to open up more and more.

## AMOS

AMOS is the website containing various apps and features you take advantage of to accomplish whatâ€™s important to you. There are some general things to consider and be aware of.

**Passersby** : are individuals unknown \(NOT signed in\) to AMOS who can view _public data_ on the platform.

**Users** : are known \(signed in\) to AMOS who can view _public data_.

**Followers** : are users who choose to "follow" \(walk near\) another user. They can view _public data_, _follower-only data_, and will see when there is unread content available to them.

**Subscribers** : are followers who request to "subscribe" \(walk with\) another user, if the other user confirms the request. The follower gains additional access to _subscriber-only data_. Further, subscribers are the only users able to enter into the conversation with the user they subscribed to. Finally, the subscriber may choose to go back to being a follower and even unfollow the user altogether.

The connection escalation of a stranger usually goes like this: The passerby notices you \(and 8fold\) and signs up for an account; becoming a user. The user finds you again and begins following your content to add you to their list of "personas I care about"; becoming a follower. The follower sends you a request to become a subscriber. You decide whether to accept or reject the request \(optionally sending them a message as to why\). If accepted, the follower becomes a subscriber and can now comment on your content and see subscriber-only content as well.

**Contributors** : are subscribers who can work with you on certain types of projects and content. You must invite them to become contributors.

All content visibility is determined by you, the content creator.

## Four Levels of Visibility

**Public** : content is available to everyone from passersby to subscribers.

**Follower-only** : content is available to users who explicitly opt-in to receiving this and public data.

**Subscriber-only** : content is available to users who request and are approved to receive this, follower-only, and public data.

**Private** : content is available only to the creator.

All content begins as private.

No sub-post can be made to have higher visibility than its parent. For example, you post something for followers-only. Someone comments on that post. They cannot make their comment public. Further, they could choose to make the comment private, only the two of you, or for subscribers.

You can apply levels of visibility to almost all of your data; this includes personas, applications, and posts.
