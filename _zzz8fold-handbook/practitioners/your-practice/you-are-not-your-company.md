# You are not Your Company

If you are providing products or services for purchase you are, technically, operating a business.

The simplest setup is that of sole proprietor. The pain point most often cited with this type of structure is that you _are_ your company and are liable for any damages caused through the sale of your products and services. Therefore, if someone brings a lawsuit against you for a product or service, then your personal assets are more easily on the table of said lawsuit.

For example, you sell something online and receive payment while operating as a sole proprietor. A purchaser of that product or service decides to take you to court. \
The judge in the case favors the prosecution and you are bound to pay a large sum of money. Paying this large sum of money may result in you selling your home or the court seizing other assets, including your television or your shirt.

It is possible to register a fictitious name and many artists and authors will do just that. This name is usually placed under the heading **Doing Business As (or DBA)**, which allows you to receive checks made out to the fictitious name or to add that name to accounts at financial institutions.

Corporations exist to separate your personal assets and liability from those of your corporation. The simplest setup in most cases is the **single-member limited-liability corporation**. The single-member LLC has two flavors. 

The first is a **regarded entity**, which is closer to being a sole proprietor as the company's assets and liabilities are closer to your own and, for tax purposes, the company is viewed more as a sub-entity of you instead of the other way around. The second is a **disregarded entity**, which fully separates the company from you; you file taxes for yourself and taxes are filed for the company itself. Either can be perfectly acceptable and you should weigh the options, costs, and benefits. The big two for our purposes are related to legal liability and moral conviction.

* The Pros
  * Legal battles are with your company and its assets, not you and yours. \(There is something called [piercing the corporate veil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercing_the_corporate_veil) in which you and your assets are considered part of the corporate lawsuit; so, be aware of that.\)
* The Cons
  * Some see this separation as protecting irresponsible or malicious business people. \(ex. A corporate executive who funnels millions of dollars from the company to purchase a yacht. Because even if the company goes under and corporate assets must be sold, "I get to keep my yacht."\)

So, no guarantees. Recommendations to help keep things separate just for the sake of sanity.

* Have a business financial account that is separate from your personal account, preferably a different institution.
* Decide what you want your business to own and try and use it only for business, which will make taxes easier.
  * If *you* own a 50 inch television, placing it in your office or renting it to others as part of your business is suspicious behavior. Instead, transfer the TV to your company, even if you sometimes use it personally; see next example.
  * Your company can have a lease on a computer, which you do business-related work on and use for personal things on occasion, during tax season, put the percentages for business and personal use for all equipment claimed. 

Another benefit to separating yourself from your company revolves around the psychology of self-identity. If you _are_ your company and the company is no longer around, _you_ are no longer around. If your company exists outside of you, and the company is no longer around, you are still around, and vice versa, if you leave, the company remains.
