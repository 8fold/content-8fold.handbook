# Onboarding Process

There are two ways to move from being a partner to a practitioner:

1. a current practitioner in good standing recommends you to the practitioners, or
2. you, as a _partner_ in good standing, put your interest forward to become a practitioner by submitting an [improvement proposal](../../../the-inner-fold/software/ideasmith.md).

Either of those events start the process. 

Current practitioners decide if 8fold is ready for another practitioner in general. You may or may not get invited to an event. Part of the purpose for the event becomes determining if 8fold is ready for you as a new practitioner.

A homework assignment for all current and hopeful practitioners.

* (Passions) List your top 3-5 skills or activities you _currently_ enjoy to the point of doing **for free or paying someone else to participate in** \(skydiving is a perfectly valid response\).
* (Pensives) List of your top 3-5 skills or activities you are at least **passable at performing but requires some degree of begging, bribary, or coercion** for you to _want_ to do them.
* (Prohibitions) List of 3-5 things you will _not_ or have absolutely _no_ desire to learn or do; coercion won't even get you there.
* (Pedagogy) List of 3-5 things you wish to learn, which may be in support of your passions or pensives but not required to be.

If we choose practitioners wisely, the strengths of one helps fill the gaps of another. You shouldn't have to do it all, that's a drawback of working alone.

1. The event opens with an ice-breaker involving the prepared homework and the other practitioners.
2. Following the ice-breaker the event goes on as normal, with you participating as a practitioner during the event.

At the close of the event the practitioners determine whether to make you a practitioner.

* **Sometimes** one or more of the practitioners will say yes, with a caveat or request, which, once satisfied, may result in a yes from the practitioner.
* If the practitioners say **not the right time**, you can always try again.
* If the practitioners say **yes**, you and your member account will go through the rest of the process.

We use this process to:

* ensure strength of the 8fold brand and culture;
* establish, from your perspective, what's important and valuable to you, which gives practitioners the ability to weigh that against the needs of 8fold; and
* get the group working on something real (anyone can pass an "interview" and be hated by everyone else when it comes time to work).

Once you have been accepted, the following steps should occur.

An email is sent to the new practitioner asking for their preferred setup. Primarily it's to establish their preferred email address: personal, _their_ business, an @8fold.pro address, or a combination.

This is the latest iteration for this email and should be improved as feedback is received:

Subject: Welcome to the Fold!

\*\*\*

Hey \[name\],

Thanks for joining us at \[whatever the event was + any practitioner & event specific details\].

It's a pleasure to say, welcome to the Fold!

We use different tools that you may or may not want to be setup on:

1. **8fold Platform:** This is the only one truly required thing. If you're already a member, then you know. However, if you're not, this is where the [Fold System]() lives, which is like the limbic system for 8fold.
2. **8fold Slack Group:** Most communication flows through Slack first.
3. **Google's G-Suite:** Which can be used to [separate your personal world from your business world](../your-practice/), offers online surveys, and so on.
4. **@8fold.pro email address:** Not required but, if you would like to [keep things separate in your world](../your-practice/), can be helpful.
5. **Gitlab:** If you would like to be added to the [8fold Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/8fold) group, please let me know your handle and we'll see what we can do.

Expect invitations to this email address for:

1. The 8fold Platform, if you're not already a member. If you're already a member, then I will convert your account to practitioner.
2. The 8fold Slack Group.

You can always change the addresses once you're signed in.

I need:

1. a Google account to grant access to our corporate drive, calendar, and whatnot. Recommend using something other than your personal Google account, which could be an @8fold.pro address you never check (forward only).
2. to know if you would like an @8fold.pro address. If you do, what name would you like to have? Recommended is first-name\[dot\]last-name; however, it's not a required standard. \(Can be done at any time.\)
3. Your Gitlab handle should you want to use Gitlab. \(Can be done at any time.\)

Following this, we can work on next steps.

Again, welcome, and thanks for joining us on this journey!

\[whatever signature you would like\]

## Platform

1. Sign in to the 8fold.pro.
2. Go to your profile.
3. Manage users.
4. Find their name.
5. Change their primary type to practitioner.

## Slack Group

1. Go to Slack.
2. Under the group panel, click "Invite people".
3. Add email address, click "Send invitations".

## G Suite

There are two primary items to share from Google.

1. Corporate Calendar
   1. Go to calendar.google.com
   2. Find the "8fold Corporate Calendar"
   3. Hover over it to expose the vertical ellipses, then click the vertical ellipses
   4. Click "Settings and sharing", then go to "Share with specific people"
   5. Click "Add people", then addresses with access to G Suite applications
2. Google Drive
   1. Go to drive.google.com
   2. Find the folder named "8fold Primary"
   3. Right or option click, then click "Share"
   4. Add the address of the practitioner, as long as it has direct access to G Suite content

## @8fold Email

1. Sign in to G-Suite.
2. Launch the Admin app.
3. Click "Users".
4. Click "Add User".
5. Complete form.

If the practitioner doesn't want to actually _use_ or check their @8fold.pro account, their @8fold.pro address can be set to forward to another address by:

1. Going to the Admin app.
2. Click on "Apps", then G Suite.
3. Click on "GMail", then Default Routing

There, you can add settings which allow you to specify an address to forward from with the address to forward to. In fact, many practitioners will establish a G Suite account for their own businesses, then just have their @8fold addresses forward to it. This is nice for 8fold as well as because a live account which we are billed for doesn't need to be created and practitioners can still have an @8fold address they can use for cross-marketing.

## Gitlab

Recent change - will need to update.
