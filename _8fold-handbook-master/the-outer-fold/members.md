# Members

Members want to support 8fold a bit more than a user.

Becoming a member of 8fold requires:

* becoming a [user](users.md),
* registering with the [8fold platform](https://8fold.pro), and
* agreeing to the [Membership Agreement](../policy-palace/membership-agreement.md).

8fold is a contribution-based voluntary coalition; therefore, to remain a member you must earn the minimum [Folds](https://github.com/8fold/8fold-handbook/tree/9266f1b8accad15cf82893f17a6971a632d87742/the-inner-fold/eight/fold-system/README.md) per month for the desired membership level.

If the minimum isn't earned, 8fold will attempt to notify you. 8fold then gives you one month to earn the required Folds. If the minimum has not been earned by the end of that month, 8fold converts your account to the closest account type you qualify for; for example, a practitioner who earns five Folds would be converted to a member.

Members are able to:

* do everything a user can,
* access [the 8fold Ideasmith](members.md) to offer insight and feedback,
* access the 8fold Platform,
* qualify for discounts on 8fold software,
* earn Folds by contributing time and money,
* trade Folds with others, and
* qualify for [profit redistribution](members.md).

Members are required to [**earn 5 Folds per month**](members.md).
