# Partners

Partners are Members wanting to contribute a bit more than a member. Partners are typically, but not always, displayed as the business owned by the member, not themselves. This acts as promotional material for their business.

Becoming a partner of 8fold requires:

* becoming a [member of 8fold](members.md), and
* agreeing to the [Partnership Agreement](../policy-palace/partnership-agreement.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Partners are able to:

* do everything a member can,
* attend the monthly event to offer insight and feedback,
* be billed once per year for all domains registered using 8fold,
* free website hosting using our hosting provider\*\*,
* access the 8fold group chat,
* access 8fold Google Drive and materials, and
* establish a mini-profile \(card\) on the partner page of the 8fold Professionals site.

Partners are required to **earn 25 Folds per month**.

_\*\* Depends on site size and traffic; however, chances are your hosting will be free._
