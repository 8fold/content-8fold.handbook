# Practitioners

Practitioners are "all in," so to speak. They are partners, members, _and_ users and would like to help 8fold thrive while potentially receiving more in return by way of promotion, access, and the ability to work under, alongside, or without the 8fold brand.

Becoming a practitioner of 8fold requires:

* becoming a [partner](../partners.md),
* agreeing to the [Practitioner Agreement](../../policy-palace/practitioner-agreement.md), and
* going through the [Onboarding Process](becoming-a-practitioner/).

Practitioners are able to:

* do everything a Partner can,
* have an 8fold.pro email address with G Suite account,
* have a full promotional profile page on [8fold.pro](https://8fold.pro),
* be showcased in the 8fold Newsletter,
* access Zoom to hold video conferences,
* take advantage of the 8fold Mailchimp account and list\(s\),
* operate as a non-legal representative of 8fold,
* attend events beyond the monthly,
* vote on changes to 8fold, and
* qualify for group discount and MTO status from ICAgile.

Practitioners are required to **earn 50 Folds per month**.
