## **Building your Practice**

Paying for everything out of pocket can be a pain and doesn’t necessarily give you feedback from the market. Venture capital should come from business mentors willing to invest in your company. Crowdfunding is allowing the market to fund your idea but usually doesn’t come with the business advice seeking venture capital does. Further, business mentors such as those who volunteer with the small business association do not typically invest monetarily in your business or product.

* [**Publishizer**](https://publishizer.com)
  * Publishizer is a facilitator between authors and publishers \(& readers while the campaign is going\). As such, Publishizer is like Kickstarter specifically for authors. Further, they have no stake in the intellectual property game beyond providing the platform and 30% flat and 2-4% Paypal fees. Finally, as it concerns publishing or selling the final product through other venues and other intellectual property rights matters, that’s between the author and the publisher who decides to take on the author and book.
* [**Leanpub**](https://leanpub.com)
  * Leanpub allows you to publish a book based on Lean principles geared toward self-publishing. You can put out the proposal, get people to sign up for notification when the book becomes available. You can begin selling copies of the book before it is actually finished; thereby, gaining feedback as you go - can help with editing and refinement process.

## Automating your Practice

* Buffer
* Hootsuite

Workflow automation tools allow you to setup a chain of events across one or more software applications. For example, you can post an article to a blog and have the automation tool post notices to various social media accounts, or send you an email, or sent an email to others, or all of the above. It really depends on the tool you use and what's available there.

* [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/discover): IF This Then That has been around a while and contain a lot of automations.
* [Zapier](https://zapier.com): Is probably the most well known IFTTT alternative.

As a small business owner you probably have a lot going on and few resources to get it all done. Automation helps with this. Think of it like delegation to an employee, only it's a tool or technology. It doesn't mean you can totally check out of monitoring how well it's doing but it will usually be less often than you might feel you need with a human. Having said that, sometimes the tools can be over- or under-communicative on how well _they_ think they're doing.

Primary drawbacks to this type of automation are forgetting you set that automation up and not being able to interject into the automation flow.

For example, let's say you setup an automation that Tweets your latest post to a blogging platform, every time. If you don't check Twitter very often, then you feed might be getting littered with things your audience there doesn't want to see. Further, there's no way for you to say, don't tweet this one. Unless the posting is part of the blogging platform's flow, which many have this time setup now.
