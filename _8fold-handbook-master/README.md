# 8fold Handbook

8fold is a platform organization specializing in micro-businesses and celebrating the individual while catering to the most constrained.

As a network of business owners operating businesses differently, this handbook stores learnings to help improve us all.

Further, this handbook attempts to guide a stranger coming in to effectively run 8fold should that be required.

We treat 8fold, and its properties, as people. Like the Avengers with less danger to the world and less drama.

8fold is made of three team members beyond 8fold itself.

* [**Pro**](https://8fold.pro) maintains a curated list of professionals offering products and services to 8fold users. These products and services include health & wellness, self-management, software development, and more. Pro firmly believes in the power of compassionate service.
* [**Media**](http://8fold.media) is the voice of The Fold using whatever she deems appropriate from blogs to books, podcasts to emails, and back again.
* [**Amos**](https://8fold.software) is the keeper of the code and keys behind software development throughout 8fold. Technically neither male nor female, we tend to call him "he" due to the inference of the name and him not seeming to mind.

If you're looking for a tool to do-it-yourself, talk to Amos. If you want to hear what 8fold, as a collective, is up to, listen to Media. If you want to hire a professional to help you and those in your charge, see Pro.

8fold recognizes four types of humans interacting with 8fold itself and its team members. These types are like concentric circles wherein the preceding group envelops the subsequent group (all practitioners are users, but not all users are practitioners), these groups are:

1. [users](/the-outer-fold/users) are the outermost circle, these individuals purchase and trade products and services with one other;
2. [members](/the-outer-fold/members) _are_ users supporting 8fold and its practitioners by earning [Folds every month](/the-fold-system);
3. [partners](/the-outer-fold/partners) _are_ members who support 8fold and its practitioners earning Folds every month, which gives them the ability to promote themselves on the 8fold partner page; and
4. [practitioners](/the-outer-fold/practitioners) _are_ partners who offer products and services to users and can do so under the name of 8fold.

## Legal Representation

8fold, llc \(8fold from here on\) is a limited liability corporation registered in the State of Tennessee, USA and governed by the laws of that state.

While legally a limited liability, for profit corporation, 8fold operates more like a self-organizing, self-managing voluntary not-for-profit coalition.

It provides a comfortable place to help individuals stretch into the discomfort of owning, operating, and right-sizing a business. The hope from being a coalition is that your passions make up for the dispassions of others and vice versa.
