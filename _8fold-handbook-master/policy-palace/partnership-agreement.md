# Partnership Agreement

A partner is a specific type of member who typically wants to use more of 8fold's promotion capabilities.

The 8fold Partnership Agreement extends the 8fold Membership Agreement. Agreement with this requires agreement with the 8fold Membership Agreement.

## Time commitment

Becoming a partner qualifies you for attendance at the 8fold Monthly.

Participation in [The Monthly](../the-monthly.md) is voluntary. When you attend you have the opportunity to shape 8fold, set priorities, and contribute to the achievements of yourself, your peers, and 8fold itself. When you choose _not_ to attend, you implicitly agree to the changes made in your absence.

## Benefits
