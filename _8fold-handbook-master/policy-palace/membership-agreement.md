# Membership Agreement

A member is a user who would like to give more, or in a different way to 8fold.

The 8fold Membership Agreement extends the [8fold Service Agreement](service-agreement.md). Agreement with this requires agreement with the 8fold Service Agreement.

8fold is a member-driven organization made of like-minded professionals coming together to mutual benefit with each other and those we serve.

As a member, you agree to earn the minimum number of Folds for your level by contributing time, money, or a combination thereof to 8fold and its members, partners, and practitioners \("8fold"\). Further, by being a member, you are permitted access to member-only Services and site areas. Finally, by earning Folds you qualify for profit redistribution, described by the Fold System and governed by the Fold Policy.

There are two primary ways to cancel your membership:

1. Stop contributing to 8fold and the status of the account will be changed in accordance with the 8fold Data Policy.
2. Delete your account \(see Data Policy\).

## Solution-focused and empowered

Everything you experience at 8fold is the direct result of work performed by members with the help of users, individually and collectively. We believe those who identify a problem, or care deeply for it, are the ones most qualified to address it.

While you are not required to take on the task of finding a workable solution to a problem you identify, it is encouraged. Further, going back to ourâ€”you define and decide the work to be performed related to the proposed solution.
