# Instructor Agreement

The Instructor Agreement extends the [Practitioner Agreement](practitioner-agreement.md) and applies whenever a practitioner is operating as an instructor to an individual or group.

If the class does not result in certification, marketing materials for the class must state such.

* This course \(or class\) does not result in students receiving credentials or certifications.

If the class _does_ result in certification, it is the responsibility of the pracitioner hosting the class to ensure that all trainers and co-trainers have the necessary credentials for teaching that course in a certifying capacity.
