# The Fold System

Let's get the legalese out of the way up front. Folds cannot be redeemed for, traded in for, nor converted to cash or cash equivalents. Any member, or group of members, discovered doing so will be subject to removal from 8fold and disqualified from future membership. 8fold cannot be held liable for members attempting to trade Folds for cash or cash equivalents.

To bring levity to an otherwise serious matter: Don't be that person. It's not worth it to you or 8fold.

You remain a

* **member**, by earning **25 Folds per month**.
* **practitioner**, by earning **50 Folds per month**.

If we view 8fold as a person, the practitioners and the wider group of members and users act as the immune system, for better and worse. They can pressure people to come in or leave in accordance to various agreements. The users also allow 8fold to act upon the outside world, which it could not otherwise do; so, they're also the body. The different layers are like the concepts of self; physical-self \(users\), conscious-self \(members\), and core-self \(practitioners\).

The Fold System is a blend of the Limbic and Endocrine Systems. Or, if this analogy isn't work you, it's a way to give 8fold the means to slow our ability to make bad decisions while maintaining the ability to recognize members for their individual contributions and trade. It solves multiple traditional business functions and problems without the overhead.

In some ways, the Fold System _is_ 8fold, as a person. We are all 8fold as a coalition.

Let's look at a transaction flow. You are a user.

1. You purchase a $100 product from a practitioner.
2. The practitioner gets $90.
3. 8fold keeps $10.
4. The practitioner also gets 10 Folds.

Let's look at another transaction flow. You are a practitioner.

1. You need graphic design work done.
2. You barter with another member who's willing to do the work for 10 Folds.
3. You get the result, the other member gets 10 Folds.

Let's say this bumps that member up to a new Fold level. You are that member.

1. You go from a full fold to a double fold.
2. 8fold performs a profit redistribution.
3. The full fold value is $100, which you would have gotten as a full fold; however,
4. the double fold value is $200, which you do receive.

Now this is one simple example but hopefully you get the overview.

Note: A member cannot earn more than 20,000 Folds from monetary contributions within a given calendar year. Further, 8fold will not accept monetary contributions from a single member totaling more than $20,000 per calendar year.

Part of the balancing of the Fold System is that _continued_ contribution is valued more than one-time contribution. So, let's say you earn 20,000 Folds, which puts you at an Oct Fold. From the example of $100 for a Full Fold you would receive $800. Now, let's say you never contribute again. In 40 months you would eventually not qualify for a redistribution. Further, after one month, you would drop to a Quad Fold, which means you would qualify for half the redistribution you previously did. Finally, after three months, you would drop to Double Fold for the next six months; and so on. We want to recognize the contributions of members even after they are no longer contributing, just not forever.

[Profit redistribution](profit-redistribution.md) is only done if net profit is demonstrated.

* **Improvement idea:** Submit an idea to improve 8fold or help users in some way.
  * If the idea is discussed at a monthly and given an initial Fold value, you will be given an amount of Folds equal to the initial Fold value. \(ex. 100 Folds\)
  * There will also be a window of opportunity for members to increase the Fold value by putting in their own Folds. \(ex. 200 Folds\)
  * If you then complete the idea, you get the initial Fold value + whatever was contributed by the members. \(ex. 100 + 300 = 400 Folds\)
