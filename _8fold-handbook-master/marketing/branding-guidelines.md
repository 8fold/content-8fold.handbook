# Branding Guidelines

Values and principles represent the content of our character. Practices define actions we take in accordance with that character. From this internalized platform, branding is the "clothes we wear" and how we communicate our purpose. From an outsider perspective, a brand is the emotional aftertaste we leave. Your \(and our\) reputation. Therefore, we can only control our intent not its reception.

As 8fold values the agency of its users to communicate freely in their unique voice and style the following applies to communication from 8fold itself and the rules for incorporating the 8fold branding into your designs.

**Design philosophy:** Great design is not running out of things to add, but running out of things to take away. Simplicity is not simple.

**Editorial voice:** Deliberate, confident, inspiring, bold yet not boastful, and caring. 

**Imagery:** Enhances content while not competing for attention.

By creating this base we are able to create a consistent feel across all the properties while giving each a hint of uniqueness. An 8fold site or presence will look and feel like an 8fold site or presence; however, they can remain individually unique and blend into your own promotional materials.
