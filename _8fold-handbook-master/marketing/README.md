## Hashtags

Hashtags are a way to categorize posts on various social media platforms. There are three types of hashtags 8fold recognizes:

* **Brand:** These are considered hashtags predominately associated directly with 8fold, its practitioners, or their products and services. Therefore, when users filter on posts using this hashtag the posts will either be _from_ or be _about_ 8fold. ex. \#8foldPros
* **Generic**: These hashtags tend to be used by multiple posters. Therefore, when users filter on posts using this hashtag posts could be from or about anyone. ex. \#Yoga
* **Campaign:** These hashtags tend to be brand-specific and short lived. ex. \#8foldAgile2019

**When posting as 8fold**, please limit yourself to five or fewer, one of which being a brand type hashtag. Further, we want to be sincere and strategic in our use of hashtags; not the butt of a joke because of how we use them.

The follow tables are not an exhaustive of allowed hashtags; instead is a list of favored hashtags.
