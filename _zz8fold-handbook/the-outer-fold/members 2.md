# Members

Members want to support 8fold a bit more than a user.

Becoming a member of 8fold requires:

* becoming a [user](users.md),
* registering with the [8fold platform](https://8fold.pro), and
* agreeing to the [Membership Agreement](../policy-palace/membership-agreement.md).

8fold is a contribution-based voluntary coalition; therefore, to remain a member you must earn the minimum [Folds](../the-inner-fold/eight/fold-system/) per month for the desired membership level. 

If the minimum isn't earned, 8fold will attempt to notify you. 8fold then gives you one month to earn the required Folds. If the minimum has not been earned by the end of that month, 8fold converts your account to the closest account type you qualify for; for example, a practitioner who earns five Folds would be converted to a member.

* earn Folds by contributing time and money,
* trade Folds with others, and
* qualify for [profit redistribution](members.md).
