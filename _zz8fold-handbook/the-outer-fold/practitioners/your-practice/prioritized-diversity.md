# Prioritized Diversity

Most well-known and prosperous companies offer a range of products and services.

Consider Apple. Laptops, desktops, phones, music-related devices, personal training classes, business related programs, the physical stores, the online store, and so on.

However, it's possible for a company to diversify too early in their life to the point it causes pain.

Consider Apple \(between 1985-1997\). The company was trying to do almost all of the above and floundering. Steve Jobs came back and the board of directors urged him that they needed _more_ products, while Jobs said they needed less. Specifically, he drew a quadrant with consumer and pro at the top and desktop and portable on the side. The Power Mac G3 was Pro Desktop. The PowerBook G3 was Pro Portable. The iMac was Consumer Desktop. The iBook was Consumer Portable. Only four products to focus on. Until 2001 when they released another Consumer Portable, the iPod, which took priority as the other areas were hurting. \(_Steve Jobs_ by Walter Isaacson.\)

Having a lot to choose from isn't always good. Having few options isn't always good. Just like scaling up isn't always good and scaling down isn't always bad.

It's mainly about being able to focus and pivot. Focus reduces the number of options; sometimes to the point they cease to be an option. Pivoting is seeing the potential in something that, up until then, wasn't a priority and changing that priority.

## Diversify Options

8fold measures products and services on three primary scales:

1. Short- and long-tail.
2. High- and low-return.
3. High- and low-maintenance.

**Short-long tail** describes expected duration of return for a product or service. For example, books and movies are typically considered long-tail; however, a candy bar is considered short-tail.

**High-low return** describes level of return per purchase compared to the total cost of creation. For example, movies in theaters on opening night tend to be high-return and go down from there.

**High-low maintenance** describes the level of continued cost in time or money to receive the same level of return over a given period of time.

When 8fold talks about diversifying options it's for the same reason investors talk about diversifying a stock portfolio. Sometimes your books are selling like crazy, other times it's your course work, and other times it's something else; sometimes it might all be going great.

Diversification on these scales is not the same as having multiple, disparate offerings. In other words, we're not suggesting you become a barista, DJ, flight attendant, doing web development as your fourth side gig.

## Diversify platforms

Web 2.0 sparked an explosion of internet content creation platforms. Allowing creators to monetize that content did it again. With that said, the more dependent you are on someone else's platform the greater risk you take on.

For example, if a video sharing platform changes their algorithm that allows people to find you to the point that no one can find you, that can become problematic. Or, even worse, if that platform decides your content is no longer welcome, for whatever reason, and removes your account, you and your users are left scrambling for a new platform upon which to stand; commonly referred to as de-platforming. Or, even worse, if the platform ceases to exist because it runs out of steam in the marketplace.

Now, of course, it is perfectly within the rights of the platform creators to do this. With that said, it could slow you down to the point you lose your shirt, literally.

## Diversify offerings

8fold does not have a policy restricting the type of products and services offered by its practitioners \(or members\). Having said that, the products and services most likely easily support one another and those more successful products and services will tend to set a dominant direction while user interest will set the pace. However, all businesses will typically fall primarily into one of roughly half a dozen categories.

There are two broad types of categories: products and services. A product does not require you to be there for a customer to consume. A service, on the other hand does. Do you provide primarily products or services?

### Products

Technically we don't have to separate these two; however, we do because of the differences in delivery channels.

* [Software](../../../the-inner-fold/software/): Installed and run on a computer. Is not required to distribute via hardware.
* Hardware: A tangible good that contains or represents the value.

### Services

You provide a service to an individual or corporation under various contracts and agreements.

There is a legal agreement between you and the other person or business. There is a legal agreement between you and the other party. The contract should contain an "easy out clause" for both parties to easily exit the obligation without undue stress. Also, keep in mind that contracts are there to protect both parties; think win-win.

As a non-employee or independent there four major types of agreement or contract.

{% hint style="info" %}

* A = _You_.
* B = Your _company_.
* C = A _company_ wanting work done.
* D = An _individual_ wanting work done.
* **Corp-to-Corp \(C2C\):**
  * C signs a contract with B. 
  * C pays B. Taxes **not** withheld. 
  * B pays A. Taxes **may or may not be** withheld. 
* **1099:** 
  * C signs a contract \(or has a service agreement\) with A. 
  * C pays A. Taxes **not** withheld. 
* **W2-Contract:** 
  * C signs a contract with A \(or a recruiter or consulting firm\). 
  * C pays A \(or a firm who then pays A\). Taxes **are** withheld. 
* **W2-Permanent:** Standard employment agreement \(here for completeness\).
  * C _hires_ A. 
  * C pays A. Taxes **are** withheld. 
* **Service Agreement:** Consider this like C2C _or_ 1099 depending on accounts. 
  * D hires A or representative of B for a service. (The "representative of B" may be you.)
  * D pays and it goes to B's account \(like C2C\); or, it goes to A's account \(like 1099\).
  * Either way, D pays A or B. Taxes **not** withheld.

For services, practitioners have tried a few things and found most fall into four categories, each helping to support the others.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Coaching" %}
Helping someone work through a problem and think differently. You may be an expert in the same field as the client \(technically mentoring\) or not. The summary being you are not performing the work and you are not selling a product; instead, you are _helping_ the client become better at doing their own work.

See [Pros](../../../the-inner-fold/pro-fessionals.md).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Instruction" %}
Here you have a group of students and you are teaching them a specific skill. Generally for the purposes of 8fold you might do one of the following, which is not a complete list of what's possible only what has been tried or discussed.

* **Course:** Create a course and license to others.
* **Co-teach:** Work with a trainer to help deliver a course.
* **Public class:** Given on a day, at a location, and anyone can buy tickets.
* **Private class:** Given on a day, at a location, and only those meeting certain criteria can attend \(ex. employees of XYZ Corp\).
* **Online:** Pre-recorded, online, and may or may not generate revenue depending on platform.

## Presenting

Presenting is a service in which you are providing information to an audience. It could be training, public speaking, or something else. You might be doing it alone or with a partner. It may be open to the public (anyone can sign up) or private (only certain folks may attend). It may be marketed by you, an event, a corporation, or all of the above. No matter what, the prerequisite for all of it is content (product) or at least the idea for the content.

The return level for live presentations is typically higher than pre-recorded. You will typically get paid a flat rate, per seat (per person who shows), or percentage of the door, so to speak. (Analogous payment methods exists for pre-recorded videos as well.)

Return length for live presentations is typically what's called short-tail as you get paid once and would have to give the presentation again to get paid again. Pre-recorded presentations, on the other hand, are considered long-tail as you typically get paid for each new viewing or each new viewer while having only given the presentation once. 

Maintenance cost of a live presentation can vary based on volatility of the content (a software application might get updated every month, which drives the update cycle of your content).

Last but not least, you could license the content for use by others, which creates a different revenue stream beyond you having to do everything. The difference between someone who writes songs and sells them to others (content generation), versus a singer of songs written by others, versus both a singer-songwriter.

In many circles, this service is considered to be a form of paid or unpaid lead generation. In other words, it drives potential customers (leads) toward higher priced or more subscription-based products and services.

### Training

Consider a training service you provide. You may do so as the primary teacher or as a co-teacher. You may give it as a public course (anyone can sign up) or a private course (only those meeting certain criteria). You may give it live in a classroom environment (service) or as a training video online (product). With that said, the prerequisite for all of those is a course (product), which has no prerequisites in this context.

The purpose of the course is to disseminate the knowledge and to increase the product offerings of your organization and 8fold. 

### Speaking

Speaking is like training, only the purpose is more broad. It could be to teach, inspire, and so on. 

### Facilitation

When a company hired you to facilitate a meeting or conversation.

Primary purpose: To facilitate the conversation of a group of people to arrive at some outcome.

Other uses: Add-on services like training and so on.

Revenue generation: Hourly rate with timesheet or invoice. \(Timing can be different per contract but I typically hear about monthly.\)

### Coaching

Coaching in this context is different than contracting because you are not paid by and organization \(a legal entity\) you are paid from a person or group of people \(like a therapist\).

Primary purpose: Help an individual or group improve themselves.

Other uses: Fit revenue generation into in-between times while working a typical 40 hour week. Create a steady flow of income with more flexibility than you may get from contracting.

Revenue generation: Per session rate.

Prerequisites: None.

## **Content Generation**

Content generation is about taking the contents of your mind and putting them into a consumable format for others. As the saying goes, "Content is king." It is the lynchpin for just about everything else. You want to teach a class? Need content. You want to give a presentation? Need content. You want to write a blog? Make a podcast? Create software? Create a new toy?

Content.

Created by your, someone else, or both.

Similar to presenting, many views this as a form of lead generation. You create the content to pull people in and possibly direct or entice them to go to other areas of your business. For example, get someone to read an article about how passionate you are with yoga. This gets them interested to attend a session in your studio. They attend a few more and then sign up for a weeklong bootcamp you have that leads to a certification.

Note: We're not saying this is easy, just that this is a recommendation for building your practice.

## Product Development

While any consumable artifact is considered a product, this is mainly about products you develop to be consumed by the end user \(as opposed to, say, a course you develop to be used by you or someone else to present to end users\). Most products will have two components based on two pricing models. There's what I call the candy bar model (sometimes referred to as the commodities model) and the subscription model (or services model). It works with both hardware (tangible) and software (ephemeral).

It used to be that software operated primarily on the commodity model. You pay $100 for a piece of software and you get to keep that piece of software until the wheels fall off. Therefore, as a manufacturer, if I want you to pay another $100 I need to figure out a way to get to buy again. This is why the candy bar model didn't work for software, they're not consumable goods. You pay $1 for a candy bar, you eat it, the only way to get that sensation again is to pay another $1. Not the case with software.

The subscription model is more like the retainer for a lawyer. You pay a certain amount every month to "retain" the services of the attorney whether you actually *use* the attorney's services or not.

### Software

Web apps or other operating system platforms that can be used by end users via their devices.

Primary purpose: Open.

Other uses: Revenue generation. Practice to maintain software development skills. Experimentation on running a software team.

Revenue generation: Typically consider long tail. The candy bar model is the person purchases the software once and either never has to pay again or only pays for upgrades, which they may not take - requires a larger audience, getting new customers is the hard part. The subscription model is a little bit of money coming in an a regular basis - usually requires a smaller audience, retaining the paying audience is the hard part \(see 8fold, Spotify, and so on\).

**Prerequisites:** None.

### Hardware \(tangible goods\)

Any physical good that takes up space. You may be the one who designs, manufactures, and distributes. You may only design it. You only manufacture. You may only distribute. You may just be the name on the label.

Primary purpose: Open.

Other uses: Branding in non-digital formats. Swag to give out at conferences.

Revenue generation: See software. A candy bar is literally the candy bar model. A Gilette razor - or Harry’s - is more akin to the subscription model.

**Prerequisites:** None.
