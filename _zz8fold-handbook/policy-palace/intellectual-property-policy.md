# Intellectual Property & Content Policy

8fold believes creative work has value and you, the creator, have the right to pursue that value. Further, 8fold, as a legal entity, not a sentient being, does _not_ create anything. Therefore, intellectual property created, made, or originated from a practitioner is the sole and exclusive property of that practitioner except as he or she may voluntarily choose to transfer such property, in full, or in part to 8fold or anyone else. 8fold, however, does own the rights to marks, names, and marketing collateral related to the intellectual property of practitioners.

For example:

If a practitioner writes the code for a software application, the practitioner owns the rights to that code. If 8fold markets a software application called "Hello World!", 8fold owns the rights to the name "Hello World!", trademarks, brochures, and so on; even if that software application uses the code owned by the practitioner. If the practitioner wishes, discussions regarding transfer of ownership for the trademarks and other assets can be had to facilitate transferring ownership from 8fold to the practitioner on a case-by-case basis.
