# Practitioner Agreement

8fold Practitioners are Partners who decide to take on the highest level of commitment to 8fold possible. Practitioners are _not_ employees and this document is _not_ an employment agreement.

The 8fold Practitioner Agreement extends the 8fold Partnership Agreement. Agreement with this requires agreement with the 8fold Partnership Agreement.

Practitioners supply products and services to users and comprise the 8fold Services.

Practitioners own or are employees of their own companies who voluntarily join 8fold to benefit from its practitioner-focused services and community.

## Time commitment

Practitioners qualify for attendance at events beyond [The Monthly](../the-monthly.md).

## Benefits

_Promotional._ As a practitioner you can create a full page public profile, list your products and services, and promote your events.

_Back office._ 8fold practitioners have access to various materials, processes, and partners, who seek to reduce the administrative burden felt when running one's own business.

_When to use the 8fold brand._ If you are performing work for a client or user requiring the use of assets owned and maintained by 8fold or its practitioners you agree to do so under the 8fold brand name. Further, if you begin working with a client or user referred to you by another 8fold practitioner, you agree to do so under the 8fold brand name.

_Intellectual property._ In short, anything you develop and own prior to joining 8fold remains yours. Anything you develop _after_ becoming a practitioner with 8fold remains yours. For more details, please see the 8fold Intellectual Property Policy.
