## Automated scaling of your account

During the first month your account will remain at your current level. At the end of the first month when you do not earn the minimum Folds, 8fold notifies you. At the end of the second month, if contribution does not return, your account will be converted to the next lowest tier you qualify for.

## Deleting your account

You can also delete your account; however, doing so immediately removes your Folds, account history, and details, which may be unrecoverable. Further, deleting your account means you will _not_ qualify for profit redistribution.
