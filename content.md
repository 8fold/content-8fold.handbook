8fold is a [microbusiness](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/Microbusinesses_in_the_Economy.pdf) incubator in its purpose and approach:

> **Radical** self-reliance without **radical** self-isolation.

We celebrate the individual while catering to the most constrained.

A network of independent business owners providing a variety of products and services. This handbook provides information to help you start, run, and improve us all.

8fold and its [divisions](/operations/divisions) are treated and referenced as people. (Like the Avengers with less danger to the world and less drama.)

At the highest level, 8fold is the sum total of a [documented culture](/operations/culture), [basics for operation](/operations), one [monthly event](/operations/monthly), and [the fold system](/operations/fold-system).

8fold is comprised of four [divisions](/operations/divisions):

* **[Pro](https://8fold.pro):** Firmly believes in the power of compassionate service and maintains a curated list of professionals offering products and services to 8fold users.
* **[Media](https://8fold.media):** The voice of The Fold using whatever she deems appropriate from blogs to books, podcasts to emails, and back again.
* **[Dev](https://8fold.dev):** The keeper of code and keys behind software development across 8fold.
* **[Link](https://8fold.link):** Keeping The Fold connected.

At its 8fold has mutliple [policies](/legal/policies) informed by our explicit [culture](/operations/culture) to serve five [user groups](/user-groups). The culture and policies and promises represent the core of 8fold. User groups are defined as follows.

1. **Visitors:** Unknown to 8fold, this user group is not known to 8fold and not actively purchasing any products, services, or both. See [Visitor Agreement](/visitor-agreement). 
2. **Registered Users:** Visitors known to 8fold earning a minimum number of [Folds](/fold-system) per month. See [User Agreement](/user-agreement) and Visitor Agreement.
3. **Members:** Registered Users with a higher minimum Fold requirement per month. See [Member Agreement](/member-agreement) and User Agreement.
4. **Partners:** Members with a higher minimum Fold requirement per month and promotional pages. See [Partner Agreement](/partner-agreement) and Member Agreement.
5. **Practitioners:** Partners with a higher minimum monthly Fold requirement and who may offer products and services through and under the name of 8fold and its [divisions](/divisions).

Each user group must certify agreement to the appropriate user group agreement. The Visitor Agreement includes agreement to abide by all 8fold Policies. Each subsequent user group agreement includes agreement to the previous user group agreement.

## Legal Representation

8fold, llc \(8fold from here on\) is a limited liability corporation registered in the State of Tennessee, USA and governed by the laws of that state.

While legally a limited liability, for profit company, 8fold operates more like a self-organizing, self-managing voluntary not-for-profit coalition.

It provides a comfortable place to help individuals stretch into the discomfort of owning, operating, and right-sizing a business. The hope from being a coalition is that your passions make up for the dispassions of others and vice versa.

8fold tends to operate on pull. Therefore, some information linked here may not exist. Further, it is being continuously worked revised and revisited. Finally, without the go ahead to put it here, even the dead link wouldn't be here.
