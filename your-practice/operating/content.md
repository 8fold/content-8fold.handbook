title: Operating

Your practice will most likely fall into one of the following, high-level categories:

<dl>
	<dt>Product Development</dt>
	<dd>You create, sell, or distribute a good; software or hardware.</dd>
	<dt>Content Generation</dt>
	<dd>(Similar to product development.) You create, sell, or distribute content in the form of text, audio, video, or other media for consumption by others.</dd>
	<dt>Profession Services</dt>
	<dd>While the product and content categories generate some thing that is consumed by other, professional services offer yourself as the product; usually in service of helping to create another product or content.</dd>
</dl>

Technically they're all products but we wanted to bring the nuance of "what is the product." You may not fit neatly into one of these categories. For example, you might develop a piece of software (product) with code and a user guide (content) and provide phone support (services). From a business-perspective and for various legal and tax reasons, it's important to choose what the primary mode of operation is.

Each of these categories will have, at least, the following characteristics:

<details>
	<summary>Primary purpose</summary>
	<p>In the [.US](United States) we have what are called [.NAICS](North American Industry Classification System) codes.[^1] These NAICS (pronounced nay-ks) codes can be used to help determining business size, loan and other [funding](/your-practice/funding) related items, and so on.[^2]</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Prerequesites</summary>
	<p>What is required for you to operate this type of business to provided these products and services? Could be certifications or licesures. For example, driving a tractor-trailor typically requires special training and specific type of operator's license. Could be paperwork to be filed with various government agencies, organizations, and the like.</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Return level</summary>
	<p>For each unit of value, how much value is received in return? For example, a book (product) may cost a customer $10 [.USD](United States Dollars), but you may charge $100 USD for a one hour coaching session (service). The book has a lower return level, but may have a higher return period.</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Return period</summary>
	<p>For each unit of value, how long can value be received? For example, a United States Patent gives the owner of the patent the right to exclusively seek value of products or services provided related to that patent for 20 years. It is completely to the descretion of the paten holder what that means. The return for an one hour of your time is one hour.</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Maintenance cost</summary>
	<p>To produce each unit of value, what maintenance must be performed? For example, consider the human body, it requires food, sanitation, water, and sleep to continue delivering value. A car might reuire oil. Lightbulbs need changed. All of those fall under the maintenance costs, when applicable.</p>
</details>

## Contracts and working agreements

When entering into a value-for-value exchange, there basically three styles:

1. individual-to-individual,
2. individual-to-business, and
3, business-to-business.

Me offering to mow your lawn for $30 USD would be a form of individual-to-individual. If you are a business, however, and wanting to enter into the agreement as such, it would be individual-to-business. If I to were a business as well and we both wanted to enter into the agreement as such, it would be business-to-business.

Individual-to-individual happens all the time and has limited legal, business, or tax ramifications unless there are receipts and written contracts involved, so we'll skip that.

There are four types or classifications of working agreements in the United States. Each of these classifications can be divided mainly on tax payer lines:

|Classification |Style                  |Who pays taxes? |Who normally provides benefits? |
|:--------------|:----------------------|:---------------|:-------------------------------|
|W2-permanent   |individual-to-business |business        |business                        |
|W2-contract    |individual-to-business |business        |individual                      |
|1099           |individual-to-business |individual      |individual                      |
|[.C2C](Corporation-to-Corporation) or [.B2B](Business-to-Business) |business-to-business |Business A and B, independently | Business A and B, independently |

When it comes to contracts, the farther from the client (or primary payer) you are, the less revenue you will most likely make per unit of value. For example, imagine ABC, inc. hires J Consulting, llc. who hires B Coaching, dba. who hires J Doe. ABC pays $1,000 USD to J Consulting per their C2C contract. J Consulting pays B Coaching $500 per *their* C2C contract. B Coaching pays J Doe $100 per their contract, as a 1099.

When it comes to 8fold practitioners, they are typically classified as 1099s and will be working under individual-to-business or business-to-business agreements.

## Pricing

There are books and entire professions based on this one concept. In other words, it will not all be covered in-depth. (Get you started and operating as legal as we know how, that's the goal.)

When it comes to pricing it's mainly about determining the unit of value and who is taking on more of the risk.

You walk into a store to get a candy bar (unit of value from the business' perspective). You go to the counter and are told that the candy bar will cost $5 USD (unit of value from the client's perspective). You do a quick cost-benefit analysis to determine if the overall value you will receive from consuming the candy bar will meet or exceed the level of disappointment you will feel in letting go of the $5 USD.

Simple enough.

Did we mention there are entire professions orbiting this concept?

Let's try to keep it simple. There's pricing based on time and materials and then there value-based (or firm-fixed price). You are the provider, the client is the one paying you:

|Type |Who assumes more risk? |
|:----|:-------------------------|
|Time and materials |The client  |
|Value-based |You                |

Simple, right?

As with most things, there are pros and cons though.

From the "you" in the scendario the pro to time and materials is that you get paid for all time worked with the client and you sometimes don't have to use your own money to purchase materials. The major con for you though is that you might end up with a paranoid client who wants to see you all the time, to make sure you're not billing them unethically. Another con, for both sides, is that the contracts typically have a very fixed and detailed scope &mdash; this is what will be delivered, at what quality, and by when. A con for the client is that there's no incentive for you to finish the work &mdash; you're getting paid either way. This has led to some interesting ideas including having early completion bonuses written into the contract.

From your perspective on value-based the major pro here is that you can consider any revenue remaining upon completion to be profit; if you finish in an hour, you get paid in full, even if it's $5,000 USD. The con, however, is that if you don't optimize, don't finish on-time or early, and still have not completed the contract, you can find yourself spending your own money (also known as, "going in the hole"). Another potential pro is that the contract can be a bit more variable in scope. A con, depending on the contract, you might run into is that the payment amounts are smaller; if someone wants to pay you per feature delivered to a software system, you may be replaced before the full feature-set is realized. The con from a client perspective is the potential for buyer's remorse later on.

Most contracts will be some kind of hybrid. Contracts must adequately mitigate risks to both parties &mdash; they can't be one-sided. Contracts should include an "easy out clause" for both parties.

For example, one practitioner used value-based, milestone billing. After discovery and determining a total for the deliery of whatever the thing was, the client would pay the practitioner fity-percent upfront. The practitioner would complete a bit of the work and show the client. The client would then determine if they wanted to continue the work with the practitioner. If they decided they didn't want to, the contract would be cancelled, the practitioner would keep the money already received and the client would not be legally obligated to pay the remaining amount. Ownership of what was created would not exchange hands until receipt of final payment, if they chose to continue working together.

The details of each contract would vary slightly but the high-level remained the same:

- paid upfront (like how one might pay their car payment to drive the car the following month, and in contrast to say a restaurant or waiter who gets paid and tipped after the meal is received and eaten),
- payments broken down into chunks, and
- ownership of what was produced was only exchanged after final payment and mutual agreement.

We find this to be a very win-win, non-zero-sum game approach to contracts and pricing.

With the groundwork laid, how does one determine what to charge?

Most thougts and recommendations we've found boil to some math and mostly voodoo.

### Hourly rate (voodoo)

The common advice and math goes like this:

<i>x</i> = how much you want to make per year.
<i>y</i> = how many hours you want to work per year.
<i>z</i> = apply a profit margin.
<a>a</a> = hourly rate.

Equation: x / y / z = a

Example, solving for <i>a</i>: $100,000 / 2,000 / 0.6 = $83

So, you want to make one hundred thousand USD after working 40 hours per week for 50 weeks, with a 40% profit margin. That last bit (the z in the equation) threw me the first time I saw it. Basically, it's how you arrive at a final number, that when reduced by a percent will put you back where you started, pretty much on the penny.

Example, solving for <i>x</i>: $70 * 2,000 * 0.6 = $99,600

The reduction is 40 percent off. You might also have seen multiply by two, or one-point-two-five, or similar. Which is the same thing, but doesn't put the math in quite the same place. Let's try splitting down the middle, or fifty percent margin or off.

Solving for <i>a</i>: $100,000 / 2,000 = 50 / 0.5 = $100 (multiplying by two)

Solving for <i>x</i>: $100 * 2,000 = 200,000 * 0.5 = $100,000 (dividing by two)

This is why retail products are interesting. If you take the [.MSRP](manufactured suggested retail price) and reduce it by 20 to 70 percent, you will most likely hit the wholesale cost to the retailer. If you reduce that the wholesale price by 20 to 70 percent, you will most likely get the time and material cost to the manufacturer. And it's just turtles all the way down, so to speak. Let's use a real life example from a practitioner researching opening a convenience store:

The cost of a soda in the store is roughly $1.79 (just of $2 after various taxes are applied). To buy this soda as a franchise owner from the distribution wharehouse of the franchise it was roughly $0.51, or:

Solving for <i>x</i> (to get what to expect wholesale): $1.79 * 0.3 = $0.537.

Solving for <i>a</i> (to get waht to charge as a manufacturer): $0.859 / 0.3 = $1.79

This way we only have to change the operator to determine things. This is also why to many retail companies can afford to mark things 20, 30, 50, 70 percent off. In all but one case most, straight-commodity retailers will still make a profit, and in all cases they will break even. It's important to note that some industrusties don't mark their items up that much and, therefore, it's harder to justify discounting those items. It also makes sense as you consider the layers of manufacture, refinement, and assembly that goes into those types of devices plus overhead.

If you base cost covers time and material, the rest covers whatever isn't cover in the time and materials. This is what gets some first-time businesses in trouble. They enter with the ideal of undercutting the competition, only to discover the costs that was being included in that hourly rate. 

### Hourly rate (less voodoo)

Do the previous with a 30% markup (dividing and multiplying by 0.3 respectively) to account for taxes. If the tax rate is higher for you, use that.

1. Monthly cost of terminal loans (student, car, home, etc.).
2. Monthly cost of fees and subscriptions (streaming services, 8fold fees, etc.).
3. Monthly rent, if applicable. (Especially important if relocating.)
4. Monthly cash allowance for random spending.
5. Monthly medial expenses (medication and the like).
6. Monthly connectivity (internet, phone, etc.).
7. Monthly estimated utility costs (usually available from the utily company site or support).
8. Annual learning and growth budget.
9. 8fold 10 percent, if applicable.

If you are considering an annual salary, multiply the monthly expenses by 12. Breaking it down this way starts making the first number (<i>x</i>) from the original equation how much you want to have in profit.

Example, to achieve $100 in profit: $100 / 0.7 taxes = $142

|                         |Expense     |
|:------------------------|:-----------|
|Start                    |$142        |
|Loans                    |$2400       |
|Fees                     |$600        |
|Rent                     |$8,400      |
|Cash                     |$2,400      |
|Medical                  |$1,000      |
|Connectivity             |$2,400      |
|Utilities                |$2,400      |
|Growth                   |$3,600      |
|8fold 10 percent         |$1,000      |
|**target annual salary** |**$24,342** |

With this, less voodoo-like approach, after all expenses, including taxes, you would have about $100 left.

The more knowns you account for in your accounting, the higher your profit margin will most likely need to be to mitigate risk to yourself. 

### Value-based (less voodoo possibly more woo-woo)

It's a pretty good exercise for all types of negotiations of value-for-value exchange, it's four numbers, written by you and the client separately then revieled simultaneously &mdash; and discussed.

For you, given what you know about what you are being asked to do:

- What's the lowest amount you're willing to accept to not feel taken advantage of?
- What's the highest amount you're willing to accept before you feel like you would be taking advantage of the client?

For the client, given the value of what you think will receive and this person:

- What's the lowest amount you're wiling to pay to not feel like you're taking advantage of them?
- What's the highest amount you're willing to pay before you feel like you're being taken advantage of?

You now have two ranges. If they overlap, the chances you can work together is pretty high. If your number is way lower than the client's, chances are the client will rant about you undervaluing your work (and they're probably right). If their number is way lower than yours, chances are the client doesn't fully see the value in your work or your level expertise or sees the scope as way less than you.

No matter, the conversation and negotiation is the important part. One practitioner gave an estimate to a client who thought it was way too high and, after talking, they found out that the practitioner was going to be delivering way more than the client was actually asking for.

This gamification, if you will, seems to create the highest probability of a win-win scenario for those not normally practiced in that arena.
