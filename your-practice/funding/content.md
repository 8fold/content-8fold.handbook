We've seen it said that money is the lifeblood of your business. We tend to disagree with this biological analogy. We, instead, view money as food that is transformed by the business into other things, including blood, if you will.

In Bhuddist tradition there is the alms (or beggar's) bowl. In Christianity therre is the offering plate. Someone might stand on a roadside with a sign reading: will work for food.

They all come back to this notion of value-for-value exchange.

In some cases, the value received by the giver, is only the pleasure of giving. In others, it is a neutral exchange. In others, there is profit, interest, or administrative fees. As long as the exchange is understood, consensual, and volutary, one might call it ethical.

- Owner's equity is typical when starting up and is when the owner of the business puts their own money earned elsewhere into purchasing the means of production for the business.
- Revenue is capital acquired through value-for-value exchange via products and services provided by the business.
- Grants or angel investments is typically capital given to a business with "no strings attached"; no ownership in the company or perceived future return.
- Loans are capital investments that require repayment usually with hope of gaining more than was given by way of interest.
- Investment and venture capital are funds acquired in trade for ownership of the business in the form of shares (or similar agreement).

As usual, each comes with pros and cons for both the business and the investor.

We have listed these in order of:

1. most risk to the owner to least,
2. most perceived freedom to the owner to (typically) the least, and
3. least legal formality to most.
