It represents information and interpretations from multiple sources considered to be canonical or from subject matter experts on a running a business, focusing primarily in the United States of America, which may differ from state-to-state or smaller regions. If you have better sources or information, please do let us know.

Anyone can participate in a value-for-value exchange. The parties involved determine what that exchange consists of. A few questions consistently get answered when it comes to running and business and whether you are classified as a business:

- Who gets paid?
- Who pays taxes?
- Who gets sued?
- Who "owns" the business and assets?

As an overview we will use the following major categories:[^1]

- individual,
- doing business as,
- partnerships,
- company, and 
- corporation.

[.DBA](Doing business as) deserves a note here. Quick definition on what is meant by legal entity: has the legal capacity to enter into agreements or contracts, assume obligations, incur and pay debts, sue and be sued in its own right, and to be held responsible for its actions.[^2] You, as an individual are a legal entity. A partnership, company, and corporation are legal entities as well. A DBA, is basically an alias &mdash; an assumed name. Any legal entity can have a legally recognized assumed name, if registered; this includes non-persons.

For example, let's say you have a few hobbies and are wanting to see if any one of them might work as a business. You create some type of craft goods, bake cookies, and do software development. The cost of starting all three as formal business could cost a fair amount of money with no guarantee of a short return on investment. You could start one business that does all three, but it could be difficult to name and might confuse potential customers. You could also register a company (an [.LLC](limited liability company), for example) called: J's Projects, llc. The cost of time and money may range from $100 to several thousand [.USD](United States Dollars), depending on how you go about it.

Once the company is registered with various government agencies, you could then register multiple DBAs: J's Crafts, J's Cookies, J's Cool at Coding. The cost per DBA will typically be much less than a single company; less than $100 USD in some cases. This allows you to create a bank account in the name of J's Project, llc. &mdash; add the DBAs to that account &mdash; and receive payments in those names.

Therefore, it could be argued that the cheapest (in time and money) way to appear to "be in business," would be to register a DBA for yourself as a person, have that added to your bank account, and ask people to "write check payable to X" where the "X" is your DBA a name. From legal- and tax-perspectives, you are still "just you," but from a customer's perspective you are not.

From a legal liability perspective the difference between being an individual (or sole-proprieter) or any other legal business is who that legal entity is. In the case of you as an individual, it's you. You sign the contracts, you sue people, you get sued, you own the means of production, you pay taxes. In the case of the company, it's the company. The company enters contracts (by way of an authorized agent), the company sues and gets sued, the company owns the means of prodcution &mdash; the company may or may not pay taxes.

When it comes to companies we say all non-individuals are companies, but not all companies are corporations. A company is what causes a legal separation between you and your assets, obligations, and so on and the assets, obligations, and so on of a legal entity separate from yourself. A corporation is what cases a tax separation between you and a legal entity seprate from yourself.

With this in mind, you might be able to see a possible progression: individual, no DBA; individual, with DBA; company as or with DBA; corporation. It's not that any of these structures is inherently better or worse in all contexts; rather, it's about choosing the most appropriate given your context and what you're looking to accomplish.

You, as an individual, take on all risk and responsibility. You, as part of company, typically have limited liability so long as you can maintain "[the corporate veil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercing_the_corporate_veil)" as more of a giant chasm. Maintaining the giant chasm is typically easier with a corporation because the corporation is also taxed by various levels of government.

These are the two most common concerns people have around starting any form of entrepreneurship, legal and tax responsibility. A lot will make their selection based solely on the answers to these, which is fine. There are other things to consider though, such as:

- What type of documents need to be filed?
- Are meetings required for certain types of decisions?
- Are certain meetings required on a recurring (monthly, annually, quarterly)?
- Do meetings need to be kept for those meetings?
- Is a board of directors required? If so, how many members do you need?
- Will a registered agent be required? If so, can I do it or should I hire a service?

This is the nuance detail we're not going to get into here, but they are questions to ask while researching what type of legal entity to form. In the meantime, you can get started as an individual with minimal friction.
