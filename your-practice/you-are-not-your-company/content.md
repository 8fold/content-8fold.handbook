Well, you might be your company. 

If you are an individual or sole-proprieter even if you have a [.DBA](doing business as) name, you are your business. If, however, you register with various federal, state, and local governments as a business, you are not, technically, your company. As such, the first habit to get into is thinking of and treating your company as a separate, legal entity.

- It should have its own bank account.
- It should have its own credit cards.
- It should sign contracts, with your name appended.
- It should own the means of production.
- It should do any other level of formality required to maintain in good, legal standing with the jurisdictions in which it operates.

Anything that separates you from you business is helpful when mitigating the various risks involved in starting and operating a business.

For example, one practitioner has two personal bank accounts (P1 and P2) at two separate financial institutions. Further, this practitioner has two businesses with two, separate bank accounts (B1 and B2) at the same financials institution. Money never flows from B1 to B2. Money received in the name of the practitioner is never deposited to B1 or B2. Money received in the name of the businesses is never deposited to P1 or P2. Money may flow from B1 and B2 into P1 and P2, or from P1 and P2 into B1 or B2, however. In these cases, those transactions are performed in a manner believed to be legally required by jurisdictions in which the businesses and practitioner operate.

Further, when signing contracts it's similar to signing when you are the executor of an estate, power of attorney, or similar capacity wherein the person or company is not able to sign themselves. In other words, your signature might look something like this:[^1]

```
ABC, llc.
A regional name limited liability company
by: _____________
your name, Managing Member
```

A full signature block would contain the name of the legal entity responsible for the document (ABC, llc), the legal jurisdiction and structure of the comapny, your signature, your printed name, and your title of authority. 
This further separates you and your company as legal entities. This type of signature should provide the greatest degree of separation and information to anyone reading it.[^2]

Finally, it is important separate, document, and register on tax forms those assets that belong to the company. For example, 8fold owns things like audio recording equipment, cameras, monitors, and so on. These assets are noted as belonging to 8fold itself and are registered on tax forms and used for tax purposes.

This further separates the assets of the comany and your assets.

It is possible to trade assets and you should consult legal statutes (or a lawyer) to determine the most legally accurate way to do such a change of owenership. In many cases personal assets are converted to business as part of the starting of the business itself. If you started as a sole proprieter operating an auto repair shop and now you want to be a limited liability company, you might take the tools you have purchased of the years and convert them to business assets.

Another benefit of separating yourself legally, financially, psychologically, and in all other ways is summed up well by Robert Downey Junior playing Tony Stark:

> Yeah, well, I'm not my company.

If your identity becomes wrapped up in your company, it can be really a really tough road should something negative happen to that company. It can actually cause crises in the form of existential, identity, or both.[^3]

An overall pro to this sepration is that legal battles are with your company and its assets, not you and yours. A possible con is that this same mechanism can be used (or at least seen) as a way of protecting irresponsible or malicious business people from personal responsibility.
