## Intentional Culture

8fold takes advantage of an intentional [culture](/operations/culture) that is reviewed regularly for accuracy, completeness, and as a reminder.

## Minimal Meetings

8fold has one major event per month we call [The Monthly](/operations/monthly). It is there where most major decisions regarding operations are discussed and is the default event potential practitioners are invited to per the [onboarding process](/practitioners/onboarding).

## No Employees

In order to:

* maximize autonomy,
* distribute authority & decision making, and
* shift traditional power dynamics

8fold does not have employees. We rely only on various [policies](/legal) and [agreements](/legal/user-agreements) with [users](/user-groups); any party can opt-out at any time.

## No Management

As there are no employees, there are no employees to manage; therefore, we are self-managing and self-organizing. As such, we rely on a minimal rule-set to govern and guide behavior in. 

## Results-Only Work Environment

As there are no employees or managers, you choose what you play with, when you play, where you play, and how to deliver the result.

Of course, with great power comes great responsibility and you typically get back what you put in at 8fold.

## Advice Process

For the most part, anyone can make any decision regarding the future of 8fold so long as they honestly seek and consider the advice of those impacted by the decision; often called the [advice process](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making). Further, the decision should not negatively impact the [8fold brand as a whole](/operations/marketing/).

8fold's [divisions](/operations/divisions) are designed to help protect *themselves* and others from malicious conduct.

## Like-mind, not Hive Mind

8fold thrives on diversification of ideas. 

Innovation comes from disruption and disruption does *not* come from 20 people with the same idea sitting in a room together. 

There will be conflict. There will be tension. 

Therefore, we do our due diligence to ensure the creation of conflict norms that minimize politicking, backbiting, and infighting while maximizing the ability to have passionate, civil discourse and remain collaborative.
