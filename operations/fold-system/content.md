title: Fold System
---

All Members earn Folds. Fold requirements are defined by in 8fold [user agreements](/user-groups-and-agreements).

The Fold System is a blend of the Limbic and Endocrine Systems of the human body. Or, if that analogy doesn't work you, it's a way to give 8fold the means to inform decision making and recognize Members for their individual contributions and facilitate alternative trading. The Fold System also solves multiple problems and functions seen in traditional businesses without the overhead and resource requirements.

Folds earned in a given month determine your Fold level for the following month. (Your first month is an exception to this rule.)

## Earning Folds

There are two ways to earn Folds:

1. monetary conribution, and
2. time.

|++
|+ ### Dues and fees
You sign up to make a recurring monetary contribution to 8fold. For every dollar spent, one Fold is earned.

Example:

1. You subscribe to 8fold Link.
2. You are charged $8.
3. You earn 8 Folds.
4. The net remaining after payment processor fess is added to 8fold's liquid assets.

Note: Subscriptions to non-8fold services do not earn you Folds. Instead, the person you are subscribed to earns Folds.

|+ ### One-time donation or purchase
A one-time monetary contribution to 8fold is made. One Fold per dollar, unless paid to a non-8fold service.

Example:

1. You purchase a $100 product from a practitioner.
2. You are charged $100.
3. The Practitioner earns 100 Folds.
4. The Practitioner earns $90.
5. The net remaining after payment processor fess is added to 8fold's liquid assets.

|+ ### Trade
You provide a product or service to another Member. Instead of monetary payment you both agree to trade Folds.

Example:

1. You need graphic design work done.
2. You barter with another Member willing to do the work for 100 Folds.
3. You get the design.
4. You pay 100 Folds.
5. The Member who did the work earns 100 Folds.
6. No money has exchanged hands.

## Fold Levels

Each Fold decays. This table describes that decay rate if you were to receive Folds and never recirculate them and didn't earn any more.

|Level   |Folds          |Reimbursable |Decay Rate (months) |
|:-------|:--------------|:-----------:|:------------------:|
|None    | 0 to 599      | no          | 0                  |
|Quarter | 600 to 1199   | yes         | 12                 |
|Half    | 1200 to 2399  | yes         | 10                 |
|Full    | 2400 to 4799  | yes         | 8                  |
|Double  | 4800 to 9599  | yes         | 6                  |
|Quad    | 9600 to 19999 | yes         | 3                  |
|Oct     | 20000+        | yes         | 1                  |

If you had more than 20,000 Folds, after one month, you wouldn't &mdash; regardless of how far over 20,000 you were. At that point would go from the Oct level to the Quad level. After three months at the Quad level, you would drop to a Double. Double to Full would take 6 months. Fule to Half would take 8. Half to Quarter would take 10. And you would remain at a Quarter for 12.

In short, you could "retire" from contributing to 8fold and continue receiving revenue redistributions for 40 months.

## Calculating the redistribution pool

8fold takes the balance *beyond* the reserve, deducts the estimated expenses for the following quarter, and what remains is the redistribution pool. For example, Quarter 1 to Quarter 2:

1. Balance: $10,000
2. Debt: $0
3. Reserve: $3,000
4. Estimated Q2 expenses: $3,000
5. Redistribution pool: 10 - 3 - 3 = 4 in thousands

## Determining distribution amount

Who gets how much from the 4,000 dollars from the previous example?
Consider four members:

1. John is Quarter.
2. Suzy is Full.
3. Jose is Double.
4. Gita is Oct.

We add up the Folds represented: 0.25 + 1 + 2 + 8 = 11.25

We determine what a Full Fold would get by dividing the pool by the Folds represented: 4,000/11.25 = 355

We multiply the result by the Fold level:

|Member |Fold lvl |Full Fold value |Redistribution amount |
|:------|:-------:|:---------------|---------------------:|
|John   |0.25     |355             |$88.75                |
|Suzy   |1        |355             |$355.00               |
|Jose   |2        |355             |$710.00               |
|Gita   |8        |355             |$2,840.00             |
|**total** ||                      |**$3,993.75**         |

The $6.25 from the example would be left in 8fold's liquid assets.
